/**
 * `.github/leakcheck/rules.mjs` — what may not appear in this repository.
 *
 * This repository is **public**. Everything tracked here is readable by anyone, forever:
 * `git rm` in a later commit does not unpublish a blob that was pushed, and a merged pull
 * request keeps its diff. So the only leak that stays cheap is the one that never lands.
 *
 * Every rule below was written from something actually found in the tree, not imagined. The
 * `found` field on each names the case that motivated it, so a future reader can tell a live
 * rule from a speculative one, and so that widening a rule can be argued against a real
 * example rather than a hypothetical.
 *
 * Severities:
 *   `block` — fails CI. Publishing this costs something that cannot be taken back.
 *   `warn`  — reported, never fails. Hygiene, or a judgement call an owner should make.
 *
 * Suppressing a line: put `leakcheck-allow: <rule-id> — why` on the line itself or the line
 * above it. The reason is not optional in review; the scanner does not parse it, humans do.
 *
 * Existing findings are carried in `baseline.json` so the scanner can be turned on before the
 * backlog is cleared. The baseline suppresses *what is already there*; anything new fails.
