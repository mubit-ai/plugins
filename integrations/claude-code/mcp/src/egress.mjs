/**
 * `mcp/src/egress.mjs` — the egress stage on the MCP write path (§8.3).
 *
 * Every other outbound call this plugin makes goes through `lib/http.mjs`, which checks the
 * run id (§4.3) and scrubs the body first (§7). The MCP server is the one exception: it is a
 * vendored bundle that dials the endpoint itself, so nothing in this repo ever saw the
 * request. Four things about an MCP call were therefore outside this plugin's control.
 *
 *   1. **Scope.** `mubit_learned` is the only lesson-writing tool a default install exposes,
 *      and the bundled SDK stamps a fixed `lesson_scope` on it regardless of the caller. The
 *      plugin promises that an agent-written lesson stays in the run that wrote it unless a
 *      user says otherwise, and a constant baked into a build is not a promise this repo can
 *      keep on its own.
 *
 *   2. **The run id on a write.** Every write tool takes an optional `session_id`, so without
 *      a guard the run a write lands in is whatever the caller passed rather than the one the
 *      launcher derived — and an MCP write would stop matching the hook captures beside it.
 *
 *   3. **The run id on a catalogue read.** `mubit_lessons` is the one read tool that resolves
 *      no default for the same optional argument, so with it absent the bundle sends
 *      `run_id: ""`. The transport backfills that field only when it is `== null`, and `?? ""`
 *      is precisely the spelling that defeats it — so the value goes out empty, which is the
 *      request that asks for every run the key can see rather than the one the model is
 *      working in. Filling the field is the whole of the fix; answering the question better
 *      is the rest of it.
 *
 *   4. **Provenance.** A lesson written through `mubit_learned` reached the instance saying
 *      nothing about which session or which prompt produced it; its `metadata_json` was
 *      `{verified_in_production}` or empty. The hooks know both — `stage-prompt` keeps the open
 *      turn under `runs/<run>/turns/`, and the host puts `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` in this
 *      process's environment — so the guard joins the two at write time and stamps the item.
 *      A stamp is neither a clamp nor a pin: it changes no scope, moves no run, and is never
 *      reported back as a correction.
 *
 * **Why here and not where the constant is.** It lives inside a vendored bundle whose source
 * is not in this repo; hand-editing a build artefact would be discarded by the first real
 * rebuild. The seam is the launcher: it is real source this repo owns, it runs to completion
 * in the same process *before* it imports the server, and the server's transport dials with
 * global `fetch`. So the launcher installs a guard on `globalThis.fetch` and the vendored
 * bundle stays untouched.
 *
 * The same seam carries the correction back: an extra key on the ingest **response** survives
 * the bundle's own response handling and reaches the tool result the model reads.
 *
 * **The one rule.** This code sits in the request path of every call the server makes,
 * including shapes it has never seen. It must never be able to fail a write: every branch
 * falls through to the untouched original request or response on any surprise.
 *
 * The read path has a second rule on top of it. **Failure there is narrow, not wide**: a
 * catalogue this file could not assemble falls back to the *pinned* request, never to the one
 * the bundle built. Failing open would restore the wide read at exactly the moment nobody can
 * see that it happened.
