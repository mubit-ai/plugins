/**
 * `mcp/src/launch.mjs` — the `.mcp.json` entry point, bundled to `mcp/dist/index.js`.
 *
 * The upstream server reads its whole configuration at MODULE scope:
 *
 *     const DEFAULT_SESSION_ID = process.env.MUBIT_DEFAULT_SESSION_ID || "default";
 *
 * Two consequences shape this file.
 *
 * **Ordering is a correctness property, not a style.** Every `process.env` write below
 * happens before `await import('./server.js')`; setting any of them afterwards is
 * indistinguishable from not setting them at all, because the constants have already been
 * captured. That is why there is a launcher at all rather than a richer `.mcp.json`.
 *
 * The same rule governs the two things here that are not environment variables. The egress
 * guard wraps `globalThis.fetch` and the instructions guard wraps `process.stdout.write`;
 * the server captures both handles as it starts, so either one installed after the import
 * would sit on a handle nobody is holding.
 *
 * **The literal `"default"` is what this replaces.** It is the bundled server's placeholder
 * `session_id`, and it identifies no project. This launcher derives the run id with **the
 * same strategy the hooks use** (`lib/runid.mjs`), which is what makes an MCP-tool write and
 * a hook capture land in one run — one query then returns evidence from both. If the two
 * derivations diverged, `/mubit-memory:remember` would save into a run that pre-prompt recall
 * never reads.
 *
 * Runs its work at module scope on purpose: `.mcp.json` executes this file as the entry
 * point, and the launch tests import it directly. An `import.meta.url === process.argv[1]`
 * guard would make it a no-op under the second.
 *
 * stdout belongs to the stdio MCP transport. Nothing here may write to it; diagnostics go
 * to stderr and to the ring log.

/**
 * Seven of the server's twenty-one tools, in the guide's order.

 * A blank `mcpTools` means this curated set, never "none" and never all 21. The fourteen
 * left out are ones a hook already does better (`mubit_remember`, `mubit_context`), ones
 * with no Claude Code surface at all (the multi-agent orchestration group), and the five
 * administrative verbs that a skill now reaches through `bin/admin.mjs` at no listing cost
 * (`lib/config.mjs` states the line). Nothing is removed — users restore any of them
 * through `mcpTools` / `MUBIT_MCP_TOOLS`.
 *
 * The last three arrived later, and each was excluded for a reason that turned out not to
 * hold.
 *
 * `mubit_checkpoint` was listed here as work a hook already did better. It is not the same
 * work. The `PreCompact` hook checkpoints on the host's schedule — when the window fills —
 * which is precisely the moment nobody can ask for. "Save where we are before I try this"
 * is a decision a person makes, and there was no way to express it. The hook and the tool
 * are the involuntary and the voluntary halves of one thing, not two paths to one.
 *
 * `mubit_strategies` reads the pattern *across* many lessons. Every retrieval verb above it
 * reads individual ones, so this was not a duplicated lane; it was a lane nobody opened.
 *
 * `mubit_memory_health` was excluded while `skills/doctor/SKILL.md` told its reader to
 * `POST /v2/control/memory_health` by hand at step 3. Withholding the tool never removed
 * the need for the route — it only moved the call off the tool surface and into prose.
 *
 * Each of the three ships with a skill (`strategies`, `checkpoint`, `memory-health`): an
 * allowlisted tool with nothing to invoke it is schema cost without a surface, which is the
 * failure the curation exists to prevent.
 *
 * `lib/config.mjs` carries the same list; this copy is the launcher's floor for the case
 * where config resolution hands back an empty list.
