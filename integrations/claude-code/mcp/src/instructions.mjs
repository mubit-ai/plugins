/**
 * `mcp/src/instructions.mjs` — the server `instructions` the bundled server cannot set (§8.3).
 *
 * **Why this field matters more than it looks.** Claude Code defers MCP tool schemas: with
 * tool search on — the default — only tool *names* and the server's `instructions` string
 * load at session start, and a tool's description arrives only after the model has already
 * decided to go looking for it. So `instructions` carries the entire "when is Mubit worth
 * reaching for" argument, and it carries it for the one population that gets nothing else:
 * `hooks.json` registers `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` in the parent conversation
 * only, so a **subagent** is handed no steer block and no per-turn recall. For a subagent
 * this text is the only notice that a memory exists at all.
 *
 * **Why a wrapper and not a sixth env var.** The bundled server has no hook to set it. In
 * `mcp/dist/server.js`, `createServer()` is `new McpServer({ name, version })` with no
 * options object at all, and no `MUBIT_*` variable feeds `instructions` — the only three
 * occurrences in that 5.9 MB bundle are the SDK's own result schema, `Server._instructions`
 * (assigned from `options?.instructions`, which is never passed), and the spread in
 * `_oninitialize` that omits the key when it is unset. There is nothing to set from the
 * outside, so the field is filled in on the frame on its way out.
 *
 * **The seam.** This is `mcp/src/egress.mjs` applied one layer down. That file wraps
 * `globalThis.fetch` because the vendored bundle dials the endpoint itself; this one wraps
 * `process.stdout.write` because `initialize` never crosses the network — it is answered
 * from the server's own state and leaves through `StdioServerTransport.send`, which is
 * `this._stdout.write(serializeMessage(message))` and nothing else. `process.stdout` is
 * captured as a constructor default when the transport is built, so the same ordering rule
 * applies verbatim: install before `await import('./server.js')`, or wrap a handle nobody
 * is holding.
 *
 * **The one rule, inherited unchanged.** This code sits in the path of every byte the server
 * will ever put on the protocol channel, including frames it has never seen. It must never
 * be able to break one: every branch falls through to the original chunk on any surprise,
 * and a line it does not fully understand is passed through byte-for-byte rather than
 * re-serialised. After the first `initialize` result it stops inspecting altogether.
 */

/**
 * What every session — and every subagent — is told about Mubit before it does anything.
 *
 * Derived from the SessionStart steer block in `hooks/src/session-start.mjs`, minus the
 * run-specific lines it can state and this cannot: there is no run id or mode here, because
 * an MCP server is started once and this string is fixed at that moment.
 *
 * Three things earn their tokens, and nothing else is here:
 *
 *   1. **When searching is wasted, and when it is the only option.** The steer block's own
 *      balance, and its recorded defect: it once said only "do not search for it
 *      preemptively", a negative with no positive beside it, and the trained behaviour was
 *      to never call a memory tool at all (`session-start.mjs`). The subagent clause is the
 *      half the steer block cannot state, because it never reaches one.
 *   2. **Which retrieval tool for which shape of question.** Three of the curated seven
 *      answer a question the model is already holding, and the choice between them is
 *      deferred with their descriptions. The administrative verbs that left the surface are
 *      named as the skills that now reach them, so a model that wants the catalogue is not
 *      left searching for a tool that is not there.
 *   3. **What `mubit_learned` is for.** Its own description says what belongs in a lesson and
 *      never what does not, and this is the mistake a model makes unprompted: narrating the
 *      session into permanent memory, whose cost is paid by every future recall.
 *
 * Kept deliberately short. This is always-loaded surface — it is billed on every session
 * before the model has done anything, it is measured by `scripts/measure-context-cost.mjs`
 * into `scripts/context-cost.json`, and `marketplace.json` declares the total.
