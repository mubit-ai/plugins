/**
 * `lib/actor.mjs` — who the human behind a session is, without ever asking them.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Attribution is metadata. It is NOT `user_id`.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious implementation of this feature — fill `cfg.userId` in with a detected login —
 * is actively harmful, and the reason is the whole design of this module.
 *
 * `cfg.userId` reaches the wire as `user_id` on every ingest item (`capture.mjs`,
 * `drain.mjs`, `session-end.mjs`, `checkpoint.mjs`). `user_id` is not an attribution tag:
 * **it also narrows what a query returns**. `lib/recall.mjs` never sends a `user_id`, so
 * stamping a detected login into it would scope every newly captured entry away from what
 * recall reads — the memory would keep being written
 * and would go silently invisible, which is the worst failure mode a memory layer has.
 *
 * So the actor rides in `metadata_json`, which is free-form, is already on every ingest item,
 * and survives into the stored entry. `cfg.userId` keeps exactly the meaning it has always
 * had, and stays empty by default.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two exports, because the hot path and the ladder have different budgets
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `readActor(cfg)` is what `capture.mjs` calls on **every** PostToolUse. It reads one small
 * JSON file and returns. No subprocess, no network, no directory walk.
 *
 * `resolveActor(cfg, projectDir)` is the detection ladder and the only thing that writes the
 * cache. It is called from `hooks/src/drain.mjs`, which is detached, unbudgeted and has
 * nothing waiting on it — the only place in this plugin where spending two `git` spawns is
 * affordable.
 *
 * Both are total. A failure here costs the actor and never the hook.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ladder, cheapest rung first
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. `cfg.actorId`                     — the explicit setting / `MUBIT_CC_ACTOR_ID`
 *   2. `git config --get github.user`    — set by anyone who has used `gh auth`/`hub`
 *   3. `git config --get user.email`     — the local-part, before the `@`
 *   4. `git config --get user.name`      — sanitised into the `TYPE:NAME` shape
 *   5. `$USER` / `$USERNAME` / `$LOGNAME`
 *
 * **`gh api user` is deliberately not a rung.** It is the one call that would return the
 * canonical GitHub login, and it is unaffordable twice over: it is a process spawn, and it is
 * a *network* round trip. Even sitting behind a 30-day cache it has no place here, because a
 * cache miss is a cache miss on whatever hook happens to be running — and one of this
 * module's callers is on the per-tool-call path. Rungs 2-4 resolve to the same login for
 * anyone who has ever pushed to GitHub from this machine, which is the population that would
 * have benefited from rung 6 anyway.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `${dataDir}/actor.json` — 30 days
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `{v:1, at, actor, source}`, structured after the health cache in `lib/http.mjs`. It owns
 * its own TTL and is never touched by `pruneStale`.
 *
 * The cache is only ever **written** by `drain.mjs`, so the very first capture in a fresh
 * data dir carries no actor at all. That is accepted rather than worked around: `stage-prompt`
 * spawns the drainer on `UserPromptSubmit`, which normally lands well before the first
 * `PostToolUse` of the session, and the alternative — letting `capture` detect — puts two
 * `git` spawns on the hot path to rescue one item.
 *
 * A *failed* detection is deliberately not cached. Caching `''` for thirty days would mean a
 * developer who configures git tomorrow goes unattributed until next month, and the cost of
 * being wrong here is one extra pair of guarded spawns per drain on a machine that has
 * nothing to find.
 *
 * Constraints, as everywhere in `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only,
 * synchronous, and nothing here throws.
