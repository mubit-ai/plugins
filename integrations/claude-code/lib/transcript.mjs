/**
 * `lib/transcript.mjs` — reading a transcript forwards, from a resumable byte offset.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is not one of the readers we already have
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every transcript reader in this tree is a **tail** reader on a hot path.
 * `hooks/src/checkpoint.mjs` takes the last 200 KB of one file because everything before it
 * is about to be compacted away; `lib/codex-rollout.mjs` takes the last 512 KB because the
 * record it wants is the most recent one, and its head reader takes the first 256 KB because
 * the task is the first thing in the file. All three are bounded so that a hook's cost is not
 * a function of session length.
 *
 * Both of them handle a truncated line the same way, and it is the wrong half of the problem
 * here: a bounded read starts or ends mid-line, so they **drop the partial first line** (or
 * refuse to parse the last). An importer reads a file from one end to the other and must not
 * lose a line at all — but it also must be able to stop and come back, so what it needs is
 * the *offset* of the last complete line rather than a window.
 *
 * That is the whole of this module's difference: it yields `{text, offset}` where `offset` is
 * a byte position that is always a line boundary, so a caller can store it and resume there
 * later with nothing skipped and nothing seen twice. A trailing fragment with no newline is
 * not yielded and not counted — it is a line the host is still writing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One inverted rule, and it is the point of the exercise
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `checkpoint.mjs`'s `messageText` ends `if (type) return '';` — it discards every
 * `tool_use` and `tool_result` block, and its comment says why: *"their content is already
 * captured item-by-item by `capture.mjs` through the ordinary ingest path"*. That is true of
 * a live session and false of a historical one. On a transcript from before the plugin was
 * installed nothing was ever captured, so those blocks are not a duplicate of the record —
 * they **are** the record, and dropping them would import a month of work as a sequence of
 * prose messages with every command, edit and result removed.
 *
 * So the rule is an option (`includeTools`), off by default so the two existing callers keep
 * the behaviour their comments argue for, and on for the importer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both hosts, one reader
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Claude Code nests the record under `message`; Codex nests it under `payload`, but only some
 * `payload`s are conversation. The envelope sniff is `checkpoint.mjs`'s, moved here rather
 * than copied, because it was already carried in three places — `renderEntry`,
 * `messageRecord`/`messageText`, and `codex-rollout.mjs`'s `blockText`, whose own comment
 * says it "mirrors the checkpoint reader's rules". A rule that is mirrored is a rule that
 * drifts.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Bounds
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A transcript line is model-authored and unbounded: a committed bundle's inline sourcemap is
 * ~700 KB on one line, and an offloaded tool result's preview can be larger. Lines are read
 * through a fixed-size window and one longer than `MAX_LINE_BYTES` is skipped rather than
 * buffered — reported as `oversize`, never silently. The reader's memory is therefore a
 * function of `MAX_LINE_BYTES`, not of the file.
 *
 * Constraints shared with the rest of `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins, no
 * import outside `lib/`, everything synchronous, and nothing here throws.
