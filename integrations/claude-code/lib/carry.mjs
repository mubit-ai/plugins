 * `lib/carry.mjs` — the block one turn leaves for the next (`recallAsync`).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a file, and not `"async": true`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Claude Code really does have a backgrounding path for hooks. As of 2.1.235 a hook
 * registration honours two fields the published hook reference does not document: `async`,
 * which runs the hook in the background without blocking, and `asyncRewake`, which does the
 * same and additionally wakes the model when the hook exits 2 (a blocking error). The host
 * bounds the resulting flush with a timeout of its own. So the mechanism is real. It is
 * simply **not runtime-flippable**: `async` is a static field of a `hooks.json`
 * registration, and nothing in a manifest can be conditioned on a config key the user sets
 * after install. Expressing a flag-gated `recallAsync` that way needs two registrations of
 * the same hook — one async, one not — each no-oping when the other is meant to be in
 * charge. That is two node processes in front of every prompt, forever, including for the
 * people who never turn the flag on. The flag exists precisely so that they pay nothing.
 *
 * Carry-forward routes around it with no manifest change at all. The synchronous hook reads
 * a block the previous turn's detached refresh left here and returns; the refresh dials
 * without a prompt waiting on it. Same trade — one turn of staleness, never blocking, never
 * timing out — runtime-flippable, and testable offline.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The file is an `Outcome`, deliberately
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `takeCarry` hands back exactly the shape `recallBlock` returns, so the rendering, the
 * `recalled` write and the seen-set mark are one code path in both modes. A second shape
 * here would be a second place for `pointers` or `refIds` to go missing — and `pointers` is
 * what decides whether the injected wrapper explains its own reference lines.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Consume-once is the load-bearing rule
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `takeCarry` unlinks what it reads. A refresh that stops answering — the endpoint went
 * down, the child was reaped, the breaker opened — must not leave the last good block to be
 * re-injected on every prompt for the rest of the session. That failure is worse than no
 * recall at all: it costs full price forever to answer a question the user moved on from,
 * and it looks like a working memory layer the whole time.
 *
 * The TTL is the same rule against a slower clock, for the laptop that was closed mid-turn.
 *
 * The three rules `lib/seen.mjs` and `lib/spool.mjs` share hold here too:
 *
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, no import outside `lib/`.
 *   2. Everything is synchronous. A hook process is about to exit.
 *   3. Nothing throws. Losing this file costs one un-recalled turn, never a prompt.

/**
 * How long a carried block stays injectable.
 *
 * One turn of staleness is the trade this mode makes and it is a fair one — a lesson does
 * not stop being a lesson in thirty seconds. Fifteen minutes of it is a different thing: the
 * block was retrieved against a prompt the user has long since finished with, and injecting
 * it spends the token budget describing the wrong problem.
 *
 * The refresh runs on every prompt, so an active session never comes near this bound. What
 * it catches is the session that was left open over lunch and the laptop that was closed
 * mid-turn — where the next thing the user types is a new task, not a continuation.
 *
 * Shorter than `SEEN_TTL_MS` (6 h) on purpose: that TTL asks "can the model still see this
 * in its window", which is a question about the transcript. This one asks "is this block
 * still about what the user is doing", which is a question about the conversation.
