 * `lib/outcome.mjs` — a staged turn -> the one implicit `/v2/control/outcome` record it

 *
 * The outcome call and its four cases, the flush of
 * turns the drain never reached), §1.3 (`reference_id` must be non-empty), §6.1
 * (`outcomeMode`).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a module and not a function each hook keeps a copy of
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Two hooks post this record.** `drain.mjs` attributes a turn as it ends; `session-end.mjs`
 * flushes the turns the drain never reached — a drainer that stood down, an endpoint that was
 * down, a session that ended first. They are separate esbuild entry points and must never
 * import one another, so before this module the rule existed twice, and the two copies
 * disagreed: `drain` learned to tell an ignored injection from an unmeasured one, and the
 * SessionEnd flush kept posting `success`/+0.2 with `entry_ids` for everything.
 *
 * Neither hook looked wrong on its own, because they never fire for the same turn. What came
 * out was a run whose outcome series silently mixed two definitions of the same measurement,
 * with nothing on the wire to say which record came from which — worse than either rule
 * applied consistently, and invisible in exactly the way a measurement bug is worst.
 *
 * So the constants, the decision and the rationale text live here once. `decideOutcome` is a
 * pure function of the turn object — no clock, no config, no socket, no mutation of its
 * input — which is what lets both hooks be tested against the same table.
 *
 * Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, synchronous, and nothing here throws.

 * | injected, but the signal could not be computed | as before: `success` +0.2 / `failure` -0.3 |
 * | per-entry data, some entries used | `success`/`failure` naming only those, minus `explicit_ids` |
 * | per-entry data, none used but some measured | `neutral` 0.0, with an empty `entry_ids` |
 * | per-entry data, every used entry judged by Claude | nothing (`explicit_only`) |
 *
 * **Row 1 is what makes row 4 legible.** A turn that recalled nothing is never sent with an
 * empty `recalled[]`: an outcome attributed to nothing is a wasted round trip that also
 * pollutes the run-level signal history the reflect path reads. Because that call is skipped,
 * "no post" means one thing and one thing only — *nothing was injected* — and the neutral
 * record is the only way "injected and unused" reaches the wire.
 *
 * **Row 2 posts nothing rather than a `neutral`, and that was the whole decision.**
 * A turn that ended on `rate_limit`, `overloaded` or `max_output_tokens` did not fail because
 * the recalled memory was wrong, so the failure branch is plainly out. `neutral` looks like
 * the safe middle and is not, for two reasons that compound:
 *
 *   - `neutral` is not "no opinion". It is a specific claim — *memory was injected and the
 *     reply shows no sign of it* — and it is already the hardest row to read, because the
 *     signal behind it is dominated by false negatives. Filing API failures under it mixes
 *     "the model ignored this memory" with "the endpoint fell over" in one bucket, with
 *     nothing on the wire to separate them afterwards. Row 4 is the denominator of any
 *     precision number this plugin can produce; diluting it costs the measurement the whole
 *     used-signal was built to make possible.
 *   - Every record still costs a round trip and a row in the run-level signal history the
 *     reflect path reads. A rate limit rarely arrives alone — one throttled minute can be
 *     several turns — so the failure mode is a burst of records that say nothing, precisely
 *     when the endpoint is least able to absorb them.
 *
 * Suppression loses one thing, and it is worth naming: the count of turns lost to API errors
 * never leaves the machine. It stays on the turn file (`api_error`, alongside `ended_at`),
 * where `scripts/mubit-inspect.mjs` prints it per prompt — local diagnosis, not reinforcement.
 *
 * **Row 5 is not a hedge.** A turn staged before the used-signal existed, or one whose every
 * distinctive term was already in the user's prompt, was never measured. Reading that as "the
 * model ignored it" would invent a denominator, so it keeps the old behaviour — which is why
 * `used` is compared strictly against `false`: an absent key is "unmeasured" and must not
 * fall into the same branch as a measured `false`.
 *
 * The turn is read, never written: the caller owns the file, and a decision that quietly
 * edited its input could not be run twice.
