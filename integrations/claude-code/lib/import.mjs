/**
 * `lib/import.mjs` — backfilling memory from the transcripts already on disk.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this is for
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The plugin is hooks-only, so a fresh install knows nothing that happened before it, and a
 * hook that times out or is dropped loses that turn permanently. The transcripts are still
 * there. This reads them.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Four properties of the corpus that decided the design
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Measured against a real `~/.claude/projects`, not taken from a document.
 *
 * 1. **The directory name is lossy and not invertible.** `~/.claude/projects/<dir>` encodes a
 *    path with `/`, `.` and `_` all becoming `-`, so the name cannot be turned back into a
 *    directory. The authority for where a session happened is the `cwd` field *inside the
 *    records* — and `cwd` **changes mid-file**: one observed session held 458 records at a
 *    repo root and 565 under a subdirectory of it. One run id per file mis-attributes more
 *    than half of it, so the run id is resolved per record, the way `resolveProjectDir`
 *    already does for a live hook.
 *
 * 2. **A large share of the corpus is invisible to `projects/*​/*.jsonl`.** Subagent
 *    transcripts live under `<session-uuid>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`, and large tool results
 *    are offloaded to `<session-uuid>/tool-results/*.txt` with only a truncated preview left
 *    in the transcript line. Both are walked; the offloaded bodies are deliberately *not*
 *    followed — see `PERSISTED_MARK`.
 *
 * 3. **A tool call and its result are on different lines**, joined by
 *    `tool_use.id` ↔ `tool_result.tool_use_id` — the call on an `assistant` line, the result
 *    on a `user` line. Nothing in this repository joined them before, because every live hook
 *    is handed both halves in one payload. **The join is mandatory rather than convenient:**
 *    `hasDeniedSubject` reads `PATH_KEYS` off the *call*, and a file's body arrives on the
 *    *result* line with no path field anywhere on it. A reader that walked lines
 *    independently would get the contents of a `.env` with no stage-2 protection at all.
 *
 * 4. **`tool_use_id` is in the transcripts verbatim**, so an imported item can carry the
 *    byte-identical `item_id` live capture would have written — `cc-<tool_use_id>`. That is
 *    the single most valuable property available here and the design is built around it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Which side of the idempotency claim is being made
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two different claims live under the word "idempotent" and only one of them is ours:
 *
 *   - **Ours, and tested.** A re-run imports nothing. The cursor for each file records the
 *     byte offset of the last complete line consumed, so a second run over an unchanged file
 *     reads zero lines and posts zero batches. This is bookkeeping this module owns.
 *   - **Not ours.** That the *server* stores one entry when it is sent `cc-<id>` twice. The
 *     ids are minted to make that possible and nothing here verifies it, because nothing here
 *     can. `lib/activity.mjs`'s note about the export is the same shape of statement.
 *
 * A third asymmetry, stated for the same reason: the **item id** of an imported tool call is
 * byte-identical to the live one by construction. Its **text** is not guaranteed to be —
 * `hooks/src/capture.mjs` owns the live renderer and `lib/` may not import a hook, so the
 * renderer below is a faithful copy rather than the same code. `test/import.test.mjs` pins
 * the id and the metadata shape, and says outright that it does not pin the text.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two sources, one loop
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A source is `{name, host, root, discover, readItems}`: where its transcripts live, how to
 * list them, and how to turn one file from a byte offset into items. This module holds the
 * Claude Code source and everything the sources share — cursors, the item builders, the
 * denylist and redaction gates, batching, pacing and the ingest loop. `lib/codex-import.mjs`
 * is the Codex source and holds only what is Codex-shaped. `runImport` walks whichever
 * sources it is handed, in order, against one item budget, and reports per source as well as
 * in total — a backfill that says "1,200 items" without saying how many were Codex is one
 * nobody can check against either directory.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why it does not use the ordinary spool
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `runs/<run_id>/spool/*.json` expires at 24 h. An import that spooled more than one drain
 * cycle's worth would silently lose its tail — the failure would look like a successful
 * import with less in it than the transcripts held. So this has its own ingest loop, its own
 * rate limiter and its own cursors, and posts directly.
 *
 * `{record: false}` throughout, for the reason the brief states as a rule: this runs on a
 * deadline looser than `MUBIT_CC_TIMEOUT_MS`, and thousands of calls that can vote on the
 * breaker would open it — which then suppresses recall and the capture drain — over a
 * background job nobody is waiting on.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Bounds are reported, never applied quietly
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every limit here answers into `truncatedReason`, the contract `lib/activity.mjs` already
 * uses: a report that says "1,204 items" while having silently stopped at a cap is worse than
 * one that says it stopped, because the first one reads as completeness.
 *
 * Constraints shared with the rest of `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins, no
 * import outside `lib/`, and nothing here throws.
