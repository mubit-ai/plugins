/**
 * `lib/state.mjs` — the durable surface under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`.
 *
 * The module API, the on-disk state layout and its TTL table.
 *
 * Every hook is a short-lived process, so anything that must survive a process
 * boundary goes through here. Three rules hold everywhere in this file:
 *
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, and no import outside
 *      `lib/` — a detached child imports this module by absolute file:// URL.
 *   2. Everything is synchronous. Sync file I/O beats an event-loop round trip
 *      for a process that is about to exit, and removes an entire class of
 *      "process exited before the write landed" bugs.
 *   3. Nothing here throws. Every caller is on a hook's critical path, and a
 *      memory layer has no business breaking a prompt (§4.9).

 * Where this machine's Mubit state actually lives, for a process nobody told.
 *
 * Hooks and the MCP server are launched with `MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR` pinned into them by setup, but
 * a command a model runs straight from the shell inherits none of that — and **the name the
 * host picks carries a suffix**: a marketplace install writes `mubit-memory-<marketplace>`, a
 * `--plugin-dir` session writes `mubit-memory-inline`, and the bare name is only one of
 * several. Returning the bare name on that path sent these commands to scan a directory
 * nothing writes to, and report "no hook has written a run marker yet" at a session whose
 * hooks had been writing markers for every prompt.
 *
 * The preference order, and why each rung:
 *
 *   1. **What setup pinned into `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json`.** That is the answer setup
 *      *recorded*, not a guess, so it outranks any search: it is the directory the hooks
 *      themselves are using.
 *   2. **A directory holding `credentials.json`.** `/mubit-memory:auth` writes exactly one of
 *      these, into the install the user actually authenticated. It is the strongest available
 *      evidence of which install is live, and the liveliness of the rest is noise.
 *   3. **The liveliest by `status/` mtime.** Every hook touches its data directory, so recency
 *      is a good proxy for "in use" when nobody has authenticated yet.
 *   4. **The bare name.** A machine with no Claude Code install at all wants a directory
 *      rather than an error.
 *
 * Rungs 2–4 are the same algorithm as `claudeCodeDataDir()` in
 * `integrations/codex/lib/boot.mjs`, deliberately copied rather than shared: that module is
 * loaded unbundled at runtime by the codex integration's `scripts/setup.mjs`, and the codex
 * package ships only its own `lib/`, so importing across integrations there would be a dead
 * path in the published plugin. Keep the two in step by hand.
