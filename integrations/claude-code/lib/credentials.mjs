/**
 * `lib/credentials.mjs` — the store `/mubit-memory:auth` writes into.
 *
 * `apiKey` and `endpoint` are `userConfig` keys, and Claude Code keeps `sensitive`
 * userConfig values in the OS keychain. There is no API for a slash command to *write*
 * that keychain entry — the `/plugin` UI is its only writer. So a command that goes and
 * fetches a key for the user has nowhere to put it unless the plugin owns a store, and
 * this is that store: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/credentials.json`, owner-only.
 *
 * It sits under the data dir rather than the plugin root because
 * `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is replaced wholesale on every plugin update, and logging in
 * again after each release is not a thing anyone should have to do.
 *
 * Three rules, inherited from `lib/state.mjs`:
 *
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only.
 *   2. Synchronous — every caller is a short-lived process about to exit.
 *   3. Nothing throws. `loadConfig` calls in on a hook's critical path, and a
 *      credential store has no business breaking a prompt.
 *
 * Nothing here logs. The values are secrets, and the redaction layer is downstream of
 * this module, not around it.
