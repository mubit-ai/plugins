/**
 * `lib/seen.mjs` — what one conversation has already been shown, and when.
 *
 * The state layout and its TTL table, and the recall path that reads and
 * writes it), §5.6 (the compaction reset).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `lib/assemble.mjs` dedupes `sourceRefIds` *within* one block — "the same entry surfacing
 * through two retrieval lanes" is collapsed. Nothing dedupes *across* turns. So a lesson
 * that stays relevant for twenty prompts was rendered twenty times, at full price, and all
 * twenty copies sat in the transcript competing with each other.
 *
 * That is the plugin's largest recurring cost by an order of magnitude. Measured against
 * the surfaces it was assumed to be cheaper than: the MCP tool names load once at 356
 * tokens, the skill and agent frontmatter once at 409, and recall injection costs up to
 * 1500 tokens **on every prompt**. Over forty prompts that is 60,000 against 356.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The scope is one conversation, and only a conversation can hold it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A pointer says "you were given this in full earlier in this conversation". That sentence
 * is only true of the transcript the entry was injected into, so the set is keyed by the
 * host session id **and** the run: `runs/<run_id>/seen/<session_id>.json`.
 *
 * It was keyed by the run alone, and the run is the wrong unit. Under the default
 * `per-directory` strategy a run id is derived from the path, so every session opened in a
 * directory shared one set for six hours. Session B was handed pointers for what session A
 * had seen, and A's compaction wiped B's record. Worse, a shell command that rendered the
 * catalogue marked the set too, and a shell has no way of knowing whether its stdout ever
 * reached a model — one verification run from a plain terminal turned the next conversation's
 * whole listing into fragments with nothing to dereference them against.
 *
 * So two things hold now. A process with no usable session id **never touches this file**:
 * it reads an empty set, marks nothing, and clears nothing, which degrades to "render in
 * full" — the fail-safe direction, and what a caller that forgets the argument gets. And
 * `bin/admin.mjs`, which is a shell command, does not call this module at all.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A roll-up, not a new source of truth
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every id in this file was already written to `runs/<run_id>/turns/<prompt_id>.json` under
 * `recalled` — the array `lib/outcome.mjs:170` later reads as `entry_ids`.
 * This is an aggregation over files the plugin is already writing, kept as one file so the
 * blocking recall path costs one `readFileSync` rather than one per turn in the session.
 *
 * That is what makes every failure here cheap: **losing this file costs one expensive turn
 * and cannot cost correctness.** A read that fails, a write that fails, an entry evicted by
 * the bound or expired by the TTL — all of them mean "render it in full again", which is
 * exactly what the plugin did before this module existed.
 *
 * The three rules from `lib/spool.mjs` and `lib/state.mjs` hold throughout:
 *
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, no import outside `lib/`.
 *   2. Everything is synchronous. A hook process is about to exit.
 *   3. Nothing here throws. A memory layer has no business breaking a prompt.
