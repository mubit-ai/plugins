/**
 * `lib/pins.mjs` — the standing constraints a user pins for one run.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What a pin is, and what it is not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "For the rest of this, don't touch the vendored server." That sentence is true for this
 * task, in this run, until the user says otherwise — and it is not a lesson. A lesson is
 * durable and crosses sessions, which is what `/mubit-memory:remember` is for; writing this
 * one as a lesson would carry it into every future session of a project where it is false.
 *
 * Before this existed there was nowhere else to put it, so it *was* written as a lesson.
 * Removing that failure is the whole reason this module exists.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two exports, because the hot path and the network have different budgets
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The split is `lib/actor.mjs`'s, for the same reason and with the same discipline.
 *
 * `readPins(cfg, runId)` is called from `hooks/src/prompt-recall.mjs`, which blocks EVERY
 * prompt inside a 1500 ms recall budget under a 3 s host timeout. It is **one `readJson` and
 * a string join**. No socket, no subprocess, no directory walk. A test asserts
 * `server.requests.length === 0` while a pin renders, because the absence of a request is the
 * only assertion a mock could not fake.
 *
 * `refreshPins(cfg, runId)` does the network and is called only from `hooks/src/drain.mjs`,
 * beside `resolveActor`, in the tail whose own comment says it is detached, unbudgeted and
 * has nothing waiting on it.
 *
 * `writePinsLocal(cfg, runId, pins)` is `bin/pin.mjs`'s write-through. Without it a pin set
 * now would not render until the next drain refreshed the cache — one or more prompts later —
 * and "I pinned it and nothing happened" is the failure that makes a feature untrustworthy.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The TTL governs when a refresh is DUE, never whether a pin renders
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **This is the explicit divergence from `lib/carry.mjs`.** There the TTL decides
 * injectability, and rightly: a recall block retrieved fifteen minutes ago is an answer to a
 * question the user has moved on from, and spending the budget on it describes the wrong
 * problem. A pin is the opposite kind of object. A standing constraint does not stop being
 * true because the endpoint was unreachable for an hour, and dropping it would remove the
 * guard-rail at exactly the moment the plugin is least able to explain why. `readPins`
 * reports `stale` and renders anyway.
 *
 * Nothing is consumed, either — `takeCarry` unlinks what it reads, because a block re-injected
 * forever is worse than no recall. A pin re-rendered on every prompt is the point.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the caps are enforced twice
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **Pinned tokens are the most expensive tokens in the plugin per unit of information.**
 * Recall's 1500 buy entries that were *ranked against this prompt* and that *degrade to
 * pointers* once the model has seen them. A pin has neither property: it is unranked, it is
 * paid in full on every prompt of the run, and nothing ever takes it back.
 *
 * So `bin/pin.mjs` refuses to write past the caps, and this module refuses to render past
 * them. The second one is not redundant: the variables surface is shared, and another client
 * can write a 50 KB value under `cc.pin.` at any time. The render path is the only place that
 * can refuse it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Subagents, and the budget that needed a measurement
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `SubagentStart` injects its own recalled block and does not pass through `prompt-recall`,
 * so for a while a subagent inherited none of the parent's pins. It does now, and the whole
 * of the work was the budget: `subagentRecallTokenBudget` is 600 against a parent's 1500, so
 * `MAX_PIN_TOKENS` — 16% there — would have been 40% here.
 *
 * The number was measured rather than picked, with `estimateTokens` over this module's own
 * render path: the heading costs 6 tokens, a realistic five-pin set (31-69 characters each)
 * costs 82 in total, and five pins at the 200-character cap cost 261. That last figure is
 * what makes `MAX_PIN_TOKENS` bind before `MAX_PINS` does, and it is the *behaviour* the
 * subagent budget has to reproduce at its own scale — not a number to copy.
 *
 * `MAX_SUBAGENT_PIN_TOKENS` is 96: the same 16% share of a smaller window. Every realistic
 * pin set still renders whole, and the essay case truncates sooner, in proportion.
 *
 * Constraints, as everywhere in `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only,
 * synchronous apart from the one network export, and nothing here throws (§4.9).
