/**
 * `lib/activity.mjs` — the audit question: what does my instance actually hold, and can I
 * take the answer somewhere else.
 *
 * The route pair this module wraps has been reachable from the plugin for a while and was
 * only ever used sideways: `lib/dashboard-api.mjs`'s `fetchActivity()` calls
 * `/v2/control/activity` to join a `created_at` onto a lesson. The export route, the six
 * request fields that turn a feed into a query, and any surface outside the dashboard's
 * browser UI did not exist. This is that surface.
 *
 * ## A module-local route constant, not `lib/http.mjs`'s `ROUTES`
 *
 * `ROUTES` is the frozen table of routes that have a typed wrapper, a `capFor()` entry and a
 * hook caller. Export has none of the three: it is called from a CLI a person types, on a
 * deadline no hook shares, and nothing about it belongs on the path a prompt waits for.
 * `lib/dashboard-api.mjs` already set the precedent for the other kind with `EXTRA_ROUTES`,
 * and `test/dashboard-api.test.mjs` pins it.
 *
 * ## The listing is distrusted; the export is not
 *
 * This is the asymmetry the whole module is shaped around, and it is forced by the wire.
 *
 * `exclude_derived` and `projection` are the two request fields whose *purpose* is the
 * compliance answer. "I asked for non-derived entries" is a claim about a field in a request.
 * "These are the non-derived entries" is a claim about the bytes on screen. If an instance
 * ignores the flag and we print the result under an `--exclude-derived` heading, we have
 * manufactured a false audit artefact — precisely the failure this module exists to remove.
 * So both are re-applied here, client-side, and both corrections are reported:
 * `excludeDerivedFallbackUsed` and `projectionFallbackUsed` exist because "the server did not
 * honour this" is itself audit-relevant.
 *
 * `/v2/control/activity/export` takes neither field. `ExportActivityRequest` has exactly
 * seven — `run_id`, `user_id`, `agent_id`, `entry_types`, `created_after`, `created_before`,
 * `sort` — so there is nothing to distrust, and `content` is handed on **verbatim**: no
 * re-parse, no re-serialise, no added newline. A compliance artefact the client reshaped is
 * not a record of what the server holds.
 *
 * ## `{record: false}` on everything, at 20 s and 45 s
 *
 * `lib/http.mjs` tags an abort `abortedEarly` — and declines to record it — *only* when the
 * caller's deadline is tighter than the 4000 ms default. Both deadlines here are looser, so
 * without `{record: false}` a slow export records `not_responding`, and five of those inside
 * the breaker's window opens the circuit: recall stops and the capture drain stops, because
 * the user asked a question about their own data. The listing reuses the dashboard's
 * `READ_ONLY`; the export gets its own, longer one.
 *
 * ## No re-redaction
 *
 * The dashboard scrubs what it renders because putting text into a web page is a different
 * consent from sending it to your own instance. Here a person is asking their own instance,
 * in their own terminal, what it holds — re-redacting would defeat the only question being
 * asked. Errors are still `scrubKey`'d, because an upstream message can quote a request
 * header.
 *
 * ## Two facts about the route that decide the request shape
 *
 * **The export has no `limit`.** `lib/http.mjs` caps *requests*; `dial()` reads the whole
 * response text and parses it in one allocation. Run scope is the only bound the response
 * body has, which is why a run id is required here rather than defaulted.
 *
 * **`total_visible` is a filtered count, not a total.** It can exceed what the client shows
 * after its own re-filter, which is why `droppedDerived` is reported next to it: only both
 * numbers together reconcile.
 *
 * Discipline shared with the rest of `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only,
 * and nothing here throws.
