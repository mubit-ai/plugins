/**
 * `lib/rank.mjs` — is this prompt asking "what is true?" or "what happened lately?".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The dial this exists to turn
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `rank_by` on `/v2/control/query` picks what a recall emphasises:
 *
 * | `rank_by` | what it emphasises |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | *(unset / `relevance`)* | the most similar memories |
 * | `balanced` | similarity, with recency in play |
 * | `freshness` | the most recent memories |
 *
 * Unknown values are inert rather than an error — which is exactly why the client still whitelists before sending
 * (`lib/recall.mjs`): a typo that silently ranks at the default is a bug nobody can see.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a rule, and why a two-way one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ask "where were we?" and the default answers with whatever is most *similar* to those
 * three words, which is close to nothing. The question is temporal: the user is asking about
 * the most recent state of a thing, not about the most on-topic memory ever stored. There is
 * real event time to rank on — the plugin already sends `occurrence_time` on every captured
 * item (`hooks/src/capture.mjs`, `hooks/src/checkpoint.mjs`) and the server stores it — so
 * the ranking is available and simply was never asked for.
 *
 * The rule answers **two** classes and no more. `balanced` is reachable only by an operator
 * setting `MUBIT_CC_RECALL_RANK_BY=balanced`, and deliberately so: a third class would need
 * the prompt text to justify "somewhat temporal", and nothing in a prompt says that. Inventing
 * one would replace a default we know is wrong with a default we cannot defend, which is
 * worse — the current failure at least has a clear story.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is not in `lib/classify.mjs`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious home looks like `lib/classify.mjs`, "which already classifies prompts". **It
 * does not.** It classifies *tool names and turn events* off a static lookup table, and
 * `classifyTurn(prompt, …)` takes a `prompt` argument it never reads — the classification
 * there is a function of the event name alone. Prompt text is a different input, needs a
 * different table, and putting it there would hand `classifyTurn` a reason to start reading
 * the argument it deliberately ignores. So the rule lives where prompt text actually is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The failure mode this file is shaped around
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Over-firing is silent. A rule that decays into a substring match fires on half of all
 * prompts, re-ranks ordinary questions by recency, and produces no error and no log line —
 * recall simply gets worse. That is why three of the triggers carry an `unless`: `latest`,
 * `so far` and `current state` each have a common, specific, non-temporal reading, and
 * "what's the latest version of esbuild" is the canonical one. `test/rank.test.mjs` pins
 * every negative; treat that table as part of the rule.
 *
 * Discipline shared with the rest of `lib/`: **zero imports**, synchronous, pure, and nothing
 * here throws — this runs in front of every prompt.

/**
 * The temporal / handoff table. One row per shape, each with the ambiguity it has to survive.
 *
 * `when` fires the row; `unless` vetoes **that row only**, never the whole prompt — so
 * "catch me up on the latest version of esbuild" is still a handoff question, because the
 * `catch me up` row does not care what the `latest` row thinks.
