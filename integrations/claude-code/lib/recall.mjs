/**
 * `lib/recall.mjs` — the read ladder, as one call (§1.8, §5.2 steps 1-4).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ladder, and why it looks inverted
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious design — ask `/v2/control/context` for a ready-to-inject `context_block` —
 * rests on the belief that the context route is pure assembly with no model call. **That
 * belief is false.** Measured end to end it costs two model calls, not zero, and the answer
 * they produce is discarded — this module assembles the block locally instead.
 *
 * | Rung | Request | LLM calls | Entered when |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | 1 | `query{mode:"direct_bypass", evidence_only:true, budget:"low"}` | **0** | always — the primary path |
 * | 2 | `query{mode:"agent_routed",  evidence_only:true, budget:"low"}` | 1 | rung 1 got **403** *and* `recallFallback === "agent_routed"` |
 * | 3 | `context{mode:"sections"}` | **2** | only when `recallAssemble === "server"` |
 *
 * **Rung 2 is opt-in, and off by default** (`MUBIT_CC_RECALL_FALLBACK`). It buys the only
 * recall an instance with direct search disabled can serve, and it pays for it with a routing
 * LLM call on every prompt, and that call routinely takes longer than the entire recall
 * budget it has to fit inside. Nearly every one of those aborts *after* spending the call,
 * so the default trades recall nobody was getting for latency everybody was paying. Rung 1
 * sends no model call at all and is the path the docs call the default.
 *
 * So rung 3 is the *last* rung, not the first, and it is never reached by default — its
 * absence is asserted explicitly by the tests, because it is the first thing a well-meaning
 * maintainer would "simplify" into place, at two LLM calls in front of every keystroke.
 *
 * `recallAssemble: "server"` substitutes rung 3 for the ladder rather than appending itself
 * to it: paying rung 1 and then rung 3 would cost three LLM calls for one recall.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A 403 on rung 1 is a verdict, not a fault
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `direct_bypass` is policy-gated. An operator turning it off is an ordinary, supported
 * configuration, so a 403 here:
 *
 *   - must **not** touch the breaker (`lib/http.mjs` never records a 403) or `auth_failed`;
 *   - **is** cached to `policy/<endpoint_hash>.json` with a 24 h TTL, so the next prompt
 *     skips rung 1 entirely instead of burning a round trip on it forever
 *     (`MUBIT_CC_POLICY_TTL_MS=1` re-probes immediately once an operator flips the dial);
 *   - descends one rung, and never two — and only when asked to.
 *
 * A **401** on the same call is the opposite: auth is broken, give up, and never cache it —
 * a cached 401 would hide a revoked key for a day. A **grant** is never cached either: rung
 * 1 succeeding is self-evident, and storing it would only add a stale-state failure mode.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a module and not the top half of `prompt-recall.mjs`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `UserPromptSubmit` is no longer the only place a recall block is wanted. A `SubagentStart`
 * hook needs one on a tighter token budget — a subagent's window is smaller and its task is
 * narrower, so reusing `recallTokenBudget` unchanged would spend a parent-sized block on a
 * three-turn agent — and an async carry-forward mode needs the same ladder decoupled from
 * the turn it will eventually be delivered on.
 *
 * Neither can import a hook: hooks are separate esbuild entry points and must never import
 * one another (see `lib/outcome.mjs` for what happened the last time a rule lived in two
 * hooks and the two copies drifted). So the ladder lives here, once, and
 * `recallBlock(cfg, o)` is the whole of it: identity and query in, an `Outcome` out.
 *
 * Everything a caller may want to vary is an option that **defaults to the config**, so
 * `recallBlock(cfg, {runId, agentId, query, deadline})` is exactly what `UserPromptSubmit`
 * asks for today, and a tighter caller overrides `tokenBudget` and nothing else.
 *
 * `resumeContext` is the one export that is deliberately NOT a rung of that ladder. It
 * is a session-start briefing rather than a recall against a prompt, it makes exactly one
 * request whatever `recallAssemble` says, and it is the only caller in this file that asks
 * `lib/http.mjs` not to record what it learns. Its own docblock says why.
 *
 * Discipline shared with the rest of `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only,
 * no import outside `lib/`, and nothing here throws (§4.9).

 * §5.2 — the budget below which rung 1 opts OUT of the server's cross-run lesson overlay.
 *
 * `entry_types` above contains `lesson`, and that alone puts the query on a second retrieval
 * lane: alongside the run-scoped search, the server runs an unscoped one to surface lessons
 * learned in OTHER runs. The run-scoped search takes a bounded fast path. The unscoped one
 * has no run to bound it by, which makes it the half of a recall least able to promise an
 * answer inside a budget — and it is the same price whether it finds a lesson or finds
 * nothing.
 *
 * So the threshold sits above anything a blocking hook can offer: `prompt-recall` has to
 * answer before the user's prompt goes out and therefore always opts out, while the detached
 * refresh behind it always clears the threshold and keeps the overlay. The dial is a budget
 * the caller already has to set, not a new one to discover, and the rule reads the same way
 * in both directions — ask for the unbounded lane only where there is room to pay for it.
 *
 * Opting out here is NOT the same as going without cross-run memory, and the distinction is
 * easy to lose: `session-start` fetches global-scope lessons once per session on their own
 * bounded route, independent of this flag, and that is the path standing lessons actually
 * arrive on. What this threshold decides is only whether the *per-prompt* overlay is asked
 * for as well. Set `recallCrossRun: "on"` to pay for it on the blocking path anyway.

/**
 * The sections a "where did this leave off" question is actually asking about.
 *
 * `facts` is deliberately absent. A fact is timeless — true before the session, during it and
 * after — so it answers "what is true here", not "what were we doing". Everything a resume
 * needs is state: what was in flight (`working_memory`), what happened (`traces`), what was
 * handed back and may still be waiting for a verdict (`handoffs`), the shape the work is
 * being done in (`mental_models`), and the constraints that were being observed while doing
 * it (`active_rules`, `lessons`). `feedback` is not asked for: an answered handoff is closed
 * business, and the answer's substance is in the next turn's traces.
 *
 * The list is paired with `RESUME_ENTRY_TYPES` below and the two cannot be edited apart: a
 * section no entry type can fill renders as nothing, silently, on a healthy 200.
 * `test/session-resume.test.mjs` checks both directions against `sectionFor()`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The known weakness of this path, measured rather than assumed
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `GetContext` does **not** order its evidence by retrieval score. It re-sorts into a fixed
 * section hierarchy — mental_models, active_rules, lessons, …, working_memory(9), traces(10) —
 * with importance second and the fused score only as a third-order tiebreak, and then spends
 * `max_token_budget` top-down in that order. So the two sections a resume question is actually
 * about are the *last* to be paid for, and on a real run against api.mubit.ai a 1000-token
 * budget was consumed by 4 lessons and 2 traces with `working_memory` rendering nothing at all.
 *
 * Narrowing this list to `working_memory,traces` was measured too and is worse, not better: a
 * `trace` is a captured tool call rather than a summary, so the block became 553 tokens of one
 * raw multi-line shell script. Both orderings are in the PR that introduced this.
 *
 * Keeping the wider list is therefore the deliberate choice: the sections that render first
 * are the ones that render *legibly*. The real fix is not a different section list — it is
 * `postQuery{mode:'direct_bypass', rank_by:'freshness'}` assembled client-side, which is
 * cheaper, better ranked and not subject to any of this. That is a follow-up, and the reason
 * `resumeContext` is one small function with one caller is so it can be swapped whole.
