/**
 * `lib/dashboard-api.mjs` — the upstream half of `/mubit-memory:dashboard`.
 *
 * Every call the dashboard makes to a Mubit instance goes through here, and three rules hold
 * across all of them.
 *
 * **`{ record: false }` on every request.** The dashboard is an observer. `lib/http.mjs`
 * settles each call into the circuit breaker by default, so a page polling every fifteen
 * seconds against an instance that is down would open the breaker for the *hooks* — recall
 * would stop, the drain would stop, and the status line would blame a server the user was
 * merely looking at. `READ_ONLY` suppresses that bookkeeping. It does not suppress
 * `allowRequest`'s half-open probe write, which cannot be suppressed from out here: with the
 * breaker already open, a poll still stamps `probeAt`. That is one field, and the alternative
 * is not calling the instance at all.
 *
 * **The key never leaves the server process.** Nothing here returns `cfg`, and every string
 * that reaches a caller passes through `scrubKey`, because an upstream error message can
 * quote the request that produced it.
 *
 * **A failed upstream is a rendered banner, not a blank page.** Every function returns the
 * same envelope — `{ok: true, data}` or `{ok: false, status, code, message}` — so a caller
 * can map one shape onto an HTTP response and the page can keep showing the local tabs.
 *
 * Five routes here have no named helper in `lib/http.mjs`'s `ROUTES` and are called through
 * the generic `request()`: activity, memory_health, archive, lessons/delete and dereference.

/**
 * `POST /v2/control/activity`.
 *
 * Two facts about this route decide the request shape. Pagination is offset-style — the token
 * is a numeric offset string and `next_page_token` is `""` once exhausted — and **`limit`
 * clamps to 1 when it is 0**, so an omitted limit does not mean "the default", it means one
 * entry. The limit here is therefore always explicit.
 *
 * The last five parameters are `ListActivityRequest` fields the dashboard never needed and
 * `lib/activity.mjs` does. Every one of them is emitted **only when set**, which is not
 * fastidiousness: an empty `user_id` is treated as a filter, so it is omitted rather than
 * sent. `exclude_derived: false` is likewise absent rather than false, so a request
 * body says only what the caller actually asked for.
 *
 * `opts` is additive and merges over the read-only defaults. A caller on a hook's budget has
 * to be able to name its own deadline: 20 s is right for a person typing a command and wrong
 * for a section of a blocking hook, which would rather render nothing than wait.

 * The route reads `outcome` (one of the four words below), `signal` in [-1, 1], `rationale`,
 * `entry_ids` and `idempotency_key`. It has no `success` field. This function used to send one,
 * and nothing else that named the outcome — so the server saw no outcome at all and answered
 * every call with a 400, "outcome must be one of: success, failure, partial, neutral". The
 * page's Worked / Did not work buttons were a 400 on every click, rendered as "failed" and
 * never investigated, because a failed reinforcement looks exactly like a flaky instance.
 *
 * `success: bool` is kept as an *input* for the page's existing body and mapped here. `signal`
 * defaults to ±1.0 — the vendored `mubit_outcome` default, and the strongest evidence the
 * system accepts; the hooks' implicit 0.2 / -0.3 exist because a completed turn is not a
 * verdict, and a person clicking a button is.
 *
 * The `idempotency_key` is what makes the button safe to double-click: without one, two
 * clicks are two reinforcements and the confidence the page just showed becomes wrong because
 * the page showed it. The default key names the outcome, so Worked and Did not work on the
 * same lesson are two records rather than one. `reference_id` must be non-empty —
 * `"global"` is the documented value for run-level attribution with no single primary lesson.
 *
 * No `agent_id` is ever sent: the backend then records the authenticated user as the actor,
 * which keeps a person's verdict distinguishable from a hook's inference.
