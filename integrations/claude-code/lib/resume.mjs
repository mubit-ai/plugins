/**
 * `lib/resume.mjs` — the briefing a session leaves for its own first prompt.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a twin of `lib/carry.mjs` and not a second mode inside it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The two files look alike on purpose: same `Outcome` on disk, same consume-once rule, same
 * three constraints. They are still two files, and the reasons are not stylistic.
 *
 *   - **Two detached writers on one path is a race.** With `recallAsync` on, `recall-refresh`
 *     writes `carry.json` after *every* prompt and `takeCarry` unlinks it. `session-resume`
 *     writes once, at the start of the session, into a window where the first prompt may
 *     already have fired. Nothing locks either write, and the losing outcome is silent: a
 *     briefing overwritten by a refresh, or a refresh overwritten by a briefing, with a
 *     correct-looking block on disk either way.
 *   - **The wrapper would lie.** If a briefing arrived through `carry.json`, `carryForward`
 *     would render it via `wrap(…, carried = true)`, which prints *"it was retrieved against
 *     the previous message in this conversation"*. This block was assembled before any
 *     message existed. That sentence exists precisely so the model can tell one-turn-old
 *     context from context about the prompt in hand; spending it on a falsehood costs more
 *     than the twenty tokens it saves.
 *
 * The TTL is the other difference, and it is the same rule against a different clock.
 * `CARRY_TTL_MS` is fifteen minutes because a carried block was retrieved against the
 * *previous prompt* and stops being about the work the moment the subject changes. A briefing
 * is about the state of the work when the session opened, which is still true half an hour in.
 * Past that the session has become its own context and the briefing is describing history the
 * model has already lived through.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The file is an `Outcome`, deliberately
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `takeResume` hands back the same shape `recallBlock` returns, for the reason `lib/carry.mjs`
 * gives: one rendering path, one attribution path, one seen-set write. A second shape here is
 * a second place for `refIds` to go missing — and `refIds` is the whole of what the receiving
 * turn credits and marks.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Consume-once is the load-bearing rule
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `takeResume` unlinks what it reads, first and unconditionally, including a file it cannot
 * parse. A briefing that could be re-read would be re-injected on every prompt for the rest of
 * the session — a 1000-token preamble describing the session's own opening, paid for forever,
 * looking like a working memory layer the whole time. `lib/carry.mjs` calls that failure worse
 * than no recall at all, and it is worse again here: this block is larger and ages faster.
 *
 * The three rules `lib/seen.mjs`, `lib/spool.mjs` and `lib/carry.mjs` share hold here too:
 *
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, no import outside `lib/`.
 *   2. Everything is synchronous. A hook process is about to exit.
 *   3. Nothing throws. Losing this file costs one un-briefed session, never a prompt.

/**
 * How long a briefing stays injectable.
 *
 * Twice `CARRY_TTL_MS`, and the two answer different questions. That one asks "is this block
 * still about what the user is doing", which turns over with every prompt. This one asks "has
 * this session accumulated enough context of its own to make the opening summary redundant",
 * which is a question about the session rather than about the turn.
 *
 * What it catches is the session that was opened and walked away from — the terminal left open
 * over lunch, the window opened to check one thing and returned to hours later. The next thing
 * typed there is a new task, and a briefing about where a different afternoon left off spends
 * the token budget describing the wrong problem, with all the authority of a section heading.
