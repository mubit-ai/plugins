/**
 * `lib/runid.mjs` — the map from "a Claude Code session" to "a Mubit run".
 *
 * Four strategies:
 *
 * | strategy                  | shape                        | derived from |
 * | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
 * | `per-directory` (default) | `cc-<slug>-<hash8>`          | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, falling back to `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` |
 * | `git-branch`              | `cc-<slug>-<branch>-<hash8>` | root + branch, so a feature branch gets its own memory |
 * | `per-conversation`        | `cc-<host_session_id>`       | the host session id |
 * | `static`                  | `MUBIT_CC_RUN_ID`            | pinned; a config error when unset — never a silent default |
 *
 * The single most important rule in this file: `"default"` is the bundled server's
 * placeholder for `MUBIT_DEFAULT_SESSION_ID`, and it identifies nothing — a run id has to
 * name one project on one machine. **No input may ever make
 * this module emit `"default"`** — not a blank session id, not a missing project
 * dir, not that variable sitting in the surrounding shell (which this module
 * never reads). Where an honest answer is impossible, `deriveRunId` throws a
 * config error; it never guesses, and it never silently falls back to a literal.
 *
 * Constraints shared with the rest of `lib/`: zero dependencies, Node >= 20
 * built-ins only, synchronous, and importable by absolute `file://` URL from a
 * detached child.
 *
 * The `cc-` prefix is not a claim about the host. It reads as "Claude Code" for historical
 * reasons and means "the run for this directory" — which is what lets a Codex session and a
 * Claude Code session in the same directory be one run, and therefore one memory. Renaming it
 * would strand every run already stored under it. The *agent role* is what distinguishes the
 * two harnesses; see `AGENT_ROLES`.
 *
 * `deriveRunId` is deliberately **not pure**: `SessionStart.source === "clear"`
 * has to remember how many times a session was cleared, so it persists
 * `clear_count` back to the session map on its way out.
 *
 * **The directory is the payload's to name, not the environment's.** Every hook
 * payload carries `cwd`, and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` — which `cfg.projectDir`
 * resolves from — is the session's *launch* root, fixed for the life of the
 * process. Reading only the environment meant a `cd` into another repo kept
 * writing the first repo's run for the rest of the session: work in B captured,
 * recalled and attributed under A. So `payload.cwd` wins when it names a real
 * directory, and the reuse branch validates the directory as well as the
 * strategy. A payload with no `cwd` — `deriveRunId(cfg, {})`, which the MCP
 * launcher and the status line pass deliberately — is unaffected.

 * reached independently is genuinely better attested than one either reached twice, and only
 * a distinct role makes that visible to whatever is counting.
 *
 * The host is *declared*, never sniffed. A Codex session launched from a Claude Code terminal
 * inherits `CLAUDECODE=1` and a dozen `CLAUDE_CODE_*` variables; a Codex session started from
 * a plain shell has none of them. Detection gets both cases wrong in the direction that is
 * hardest to notice. `integrations/codex/lib/boot.mjs` sets `MUBIT_CC_HOST=codex` before any

/**
 * Every run this data dir has a status marker for, with what the marker says about when it
 * was last touched.
 *
 * This is the *observation* half of run resolution, and it is deliberately not the deciding
 * half. `bin/activity.mjs` and `bin/pin.mjs` both have to answer "which run is this session",
 * and neither can call `deriveRunId`: derivation is what a hook does from a payload it was
 * handed, and re-running it from a CLI would compute an answer rather than read the one the
 * hooks actually used — and, on `source: 'clear'`, would increment and persist `clear_count`
 * a second time. So both observe instead, and this is the scan they share.
 *
 * What they do NOT share is the policy on top, which is why that stayed in each command:
 * `activity` breaks a tie on the higher `-c<n>` (a pre-clear marker and its successor can be
 * stamped inside one millisecond, and answering with the run the user just cleared would
 * report it as this session), while `pin` refuses a marker older than a day and refuses the
 * fallback run id outright (a pin is a standing constraint and needs a run to belong to).
 * Folding those together would mean one command silently inheriting the other's rules.
 *
 * Markers are enumerated from `status/`, never from `runs/`: the marker is the only file
 * guaranteed to exist, because a session that recalled and never captured has no `runs/<id>/`
 * at all. `health.json` shares the directory and is the endpoint probe cache, not a run.
 *
 * A marker truncated by a SIGKILL still names a run, so it is reported with the file's mtime
 * rather than dropped — the name is the run id, and that is the part being asked for. Total:
 * an unreadable data dir is an empty list, never a throw.
