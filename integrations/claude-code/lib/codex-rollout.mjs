 * `lib/codex-rollout.mjs` — the outcome of a tool call, read out of Codex's rollout transcript.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file has to exist
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Codex has no `PostToolUseFailure` event, so `capture.mjs` — which decides `failed` from
 * which event fired — records every tool call on this host as a success. A failed `rm`, a
 * failed test run, a failed `apply_patch`: all stored `outcome: 'ok'`. The failure half of
 * memory is empty by construction, and the success half carries things that did not work.
 *
 * The obvious repair is to read the outcome out of `tool_response`, and it does not work. A
 * live `codex exec` says why:
 *
 *     `sh -c "echo out; exit 9"`     ->  tool_response: "out\n"
 *     `echo hello-stdout; exit 3`    ->  tool_response: "hello-stdout\n"
 *
 * For `Bash`, `tool_response` is the aggregated output and nothing else — byte-for-byte what
 * a success sends. No exit code, no status. (The `"Exit code: N\nWall time: …"` preamble is
 * an `apply_patch` shape; a parser for it fixes nothing for the shell.)
 *
 * What the host *does* record is a line in the rollout transcript, whose path every relevant
 * payload already carries, keyed by the same `tool_use_id`:
 *
 *     {"type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"item_completed","item":{
 *        "type":"CommandExecution","id":"exec-94b2…","status":"failed","exit_code":9,
 *        "stdout":"out\n","aggregated_output":"out\n","duration":{"secs":0,"nanos":2375}}}}
 *
 * and it is already on disk when the hook runs, which a hook reading its own
 * `transcript_path` mid-turn confirmed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two rules it keeps
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **It reads a bounded tail.** This runs on every `PostToolUse`, inside a 3-second host
 * timeout, against a file that grows all session. The record wanted is the most recent one,
 * so the last few hundred KB is read and scanned backwards. A whole-file read would make the
 * hot path a function of session length.
 *
 * **Silence is never a verdict.** No path, no file, no matching record, an unparseable line —
 * every one of those returns `found: false`, and the caller leaves the item exactly as it
 * would have been. The bug being fixed is the host saying "failed" and the plugin recording
 * "ok"; guessing in the other direction would be the same bug facing the other way.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `capture --subagent` renders `Q: <prompt>` from the turn file its **parent** staged. Every
 * sibling in a fan-out shares that one turn, so six subagents in one turn are stored as six
 * different answers to one identical question — and which one did what is unrecoverable.
 *
 * `SubagentStop` carries `agent_transcript_path`, the agent's own rollout, and it is the only
 * coordinate that differs between siblings. This reads its head: the task is the first thing
 * in the file, so the whole file never has to be.
 *
 * The envelope is the one Codex writes and the checkpoint reader already knows:
 * `{"type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message","role":"user",
 * "content":[{"type":"input_text","text":…}]}}`. `input_text` is Codex's spelling of `text`.
 * Blocks matching `INJECTED_USER_RE` are skipped, because from 0.149 the first of them is
 * always the host's.
 *
 * Returns `''` for anything that does not answer — no path, no file, no user message, a
 * transcript in a shape this does not know. The caller falls back to the parent's staged
 * prompt, which is what was stored before any of this existed.
