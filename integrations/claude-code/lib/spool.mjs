/**
 * `lib/spool.mjs` — the durable buffer between capture and the network.
 *
 * The module API, the state layout and the 60 s drain-lock TTL; capture writes, drain reads;
 * and the 200-concurrent-append property.
 *
 * Capture is synchronous, hot and network-free; drain is detached, batched and networked.
 * This module is the seam. Three rules hold throughout, exactly as in `lib/state.mjs`:
 *
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, no import outside `lib/` — a detached
 *      drain child imports this module by absolute `file://` URL.
 *   2. Everything is synchronous. A hook process is about to exit; an event-loop round trip
 *      buys nothing and adds a "the process died before the write landed" failure mode.
 *   3. Nothing here throws. A memory layer has no business breaking a prompt.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why one file per item and not an append-only NDJSON log
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `fs.appendFileSync` with `O_APPEND` is only atomic below `PIPE_BUF` (4 KiB on Linux,
 * 512 B on macOS). Captured tool output routinely exceeds that, so two concurrent
 * `PostToolUse` hooks appending to one log interleave mid-line and corrupt both records.
 * File-per-item makes concurrent capture lock-free, makes a partial write self-evident
 * (unparseable -> unlink), and lets `commitBatch` unlink exactly what was accepted.
 *
 * Each item is written to a sibling temp file and `rename(2)`d into place, so a concurrent
 * `readBatch` sees either no file or the whole file — never a half-written one. The temp
 * name does not end in `.json`, so it is invisible to every reader here.
