/**
 * `lib/rules.mjs` — the per-run rule store at `runs/<run_id>/rules.json`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a file exists at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `hooks/src/pre-tool.mjs` runs on `PreToolUse`, in front of a tool call the user is waiting
 * on, and **it may not dial**. Even a fast round trip is latency paid on every matching
 * command, for a warning — and the hook has a 3 s host timeout inside which a slow Mubit
 * would spend the whole budget and inject nothing.
 *
 * So the rules have to already be on disk when it runs. Two hooks are *already* paying for a
 * network call that returns typed entries, and both of them see rules go past:
 *
 *   - `session-start` asks `POST /v2/control/lessons` for the global set. Some
 *     of those are `lesson_type: "rule"`.
 *   - `prompt-recall` asks `POST /v2/control/query` on every prompt and gets `evidence[]`
 *     back, with `entry_type: "rule"` among the five types it requests (rung 1).
 *
 * Both write here in passing. Nothing in this module ever opens a socket, and nothing that
 * calls it does so for its sake — it is a side effect of a call that was already made.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three rules, the same three `lib/spool.mjs` and `lib/state.mjs` hold
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. Zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins only, and no import outside `lib/`.
 *   2. Everything is synchronous. Every caller is a process about to exit.
 *   3. **Nothing here throws.** This one carries more weight than usual: the reader is a hook
 *      whose non-zero exit the host reads as a verdict on the tool call, and exit code 2
 *      blocks it outright. A memory layer that can throw in front of `rm` is worse than no
 *      memory layer.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is deliberately NOT stored
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Only `rule`. Mubit's model defines `rule` as a hard constraint that always applies, which
 * is the only entry type whose relevance does not depend on the question being asked. A
 * `lesson` is a suggestion drawn from one past episode; surfacing one in front of a tool call
 * is an interruption on a guess, and after a few of those the model — and the user — stop
 * reading the channel.
 *
 * Stale entries are dropped too. The server marks an entry `is_stale` for transparency and
 * `lib/assemble.mjs` already acts on the mark by ranking those entries last. Here there is no
 * "last": a rule either appears in front of a live command or it does not, and a superseded
 * constraint stated at that moment is confidently wrong exactly where it is hardest to check.
