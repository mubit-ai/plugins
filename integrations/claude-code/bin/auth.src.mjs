/**
 * `bin/auth.src.mjs` — what `/mubit-memory:auth` runs. Bundled to `bin/auth.mjs`.
 *
 * Setting the plugin up is two values, `endpoint` and `apiKey`, and until this command
 * existed the only way to supply them was: open the console, find the instance, issue a
 * key, copy it, run `/plugin`, find Mubit Memory, choose configure, paste into two
 * fields. Seven steps, each one a place to stop.
 *
 * ## Why this does not use `lib/http.mjs`
 *
 * That module is built for hooks: it caches health for 30 s, and it sits behind a
 * circuit breaker so a dead instance cannot slow every prompt down. Both are wrong
 * here. A user runs `/auth` *because* something is not working, which is exactly when
 * the breaker is open and the cached health result is stale — and "I refuse to check
 * because checking failed recently" is a terrible answer to "please log me in". So this
 * file dials directly, with an injected `fetchImpl` the tests substitute.
 *
 * ## Why the key is checked against an authenticated route
 *
 * `GET /v2/core/health` reports whether the instance is reachable, not whether your key is
 * good — the plugin needs it as a readiness probe *before* a key exists. Validating a key
 * against it would make this command a machine for producing false confidence. So health answers "is anything
 * there?", and a second, authenticated call answers "is this key good?". Two questions,
 * two calls, and the failure modes stay distinguishable.
 *
 * Nothing here logs the key, and no returned object contains it.

/**
 * The endpoints to try for the key the console just issued, most authoritative first.
 *
 * `mubitEndpoint` is the console's own answer — `httpEndpoint` from the platform API's
 * `/location` route, which is the only thing that knows what a given cluster overrode
 * `MUBIT_REGIONAL_HTTP_ENDPOINT` to. It is tried first, and the compiled-in gateway follows
 * it, because the console's answer can be right, stale, or unreachable and only the server
 * can say which.
 *
 * **A plaintext answer is upgraded, not discarded.** Measured 2026-08-28 in two clusters:
 * both report `http://`, and only one of them means it. The dev cluster's EU host answers
 * 401 over TLS and 308s plain HTTP to it; `api.eu.mubit.ai` answers over plain HTTP and
 * fails the TLS handshake. So the scheme says nothing about the host, and dropping the host over
 * it sent a dev key to the production gateway, which rejected it and told the user their key
 * was bad. Keeping the host and fixing the scheme is right in both clusters: dev connects,
 * prod's TLS failure falls through to the gateway that has always served it.
 *
 * Loopback keeps its scheme. Plaintext to 127.0.0.1 crosses no network, and there is rarely
 * a TLS listener there to upgrade to.
 *
 * No region map, either way. eu.mubit.ai and us.mubit.ai are NXDOMAIN, so turning
 * `payload.region` into one of them stored an endpoint that could never answer, and every
 * later command then failed with `TypeError: fetch failed (ENOTFOUND)` far from the sign-in
 * that caused it. A region is a routing hint for the console, not a hostname this side may
 * invent.
