 * Three properties matter more than anything this prints:
 *
 *   1. **Network-free.** It reads `status/<run_id>.json` and `breaker/<hash>.json` and
 *      nothing else — no `lib/http.mjs`, no `fetch`, not even transitively. The status line
 *      renders on every frame of the host UI; one that dials Mubit turns a dead server into
 *      a visibly frozen terminal.
 *   2. **Fast.** The §10 budget is < 15 ms. Everything here is two small synchronous reads
 *      plus a config load that is itself cached on disk. The one avoidable cost — the
 *      `git rev-parse` inside `deriveRunId` — is skipped entirely whenever the session map
 *      already names the run, which is every frame after the first `SessionStart`.
 *   3. **It never throws, and it always exits 0.** On a fresh install there is no state at
 *      all, and that is the state every user is in for their first few seconds. A stack
 *      trace there is the first thing they would ever see of this plugin. Every path out of
 *      `render()` is wrapped; the worst outcome is an empty line.
 *
 * Bundled to `bin/statusline.mjs` by §11.2 and registered by `settings.json`.

 * Merge the two disagreeing sources and apply the cold-start lens.
 *
 * The marker was written by the last hook that ran; the breaker file was written by the

 * two — a breaker that has seen five refusals is still the truth even if the last marker
 * write predates them, and a marker written by a hook that just got a 401 is still the
 * truth even if the breaker is closed (auth failures never open it).
 *
 * **Cold start is resolved here rather than by `readBreaker().display`, deliberately.**
 * `lib/breaker.mjs:290-302` only reports `warming` when the *breaker's* own state is a
 * failure, because the breaker is keyed by endpoint and knows nothing about runs. But
 * `cold_start_until` is a property of the run, which the marker owns: a brand-new run whose
 * breaker is a clean `ready` is still warming. So the lens is applied to the merged view.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DECISION — `not_responding` vs `warming`, the one pair §10 and §4.7 disagree on.
 *
 * §10's table ranks `◌ slow` above `◍ warming`, which reads as "a timeout streak during
 * warm-up still shows ◌". §4.7's cold-start suppression says the opposite: inside
 * `coldStartGraceMs` a failure "is recorded but the status line shows ◍ warming".
 *
 * **`warming` wins.** Inside the grace window every failure except `auth_failed` displays
 * as `◍ warming`. Three reasons:
 *
 *   1. *Monotonicity.* The suite pins that `unreachable` — which §10 ranks strictly WORSE
 *      than `not_responding` — is suppressed to `◍` inside the window. A rule that
 *      suppressed the worse symptom but let the milder one through would mean a healthier
 *      server showed the scarier glyph. That is not a defensible line to draw.
 *   2. *§4.7 states the rule; §10 states a ranking.* The §10 table answers "which of two
 *      simultaneous facts do I show"; §4.7 answers "is this fact a verdict yet". Cold start
 *      is the second question, and it is asked first. `warming` is not competing with
 *      `not_responding` — it is the answer to whether `not_responding` counts yet.
 *   3. *A timeout is the single most likely thing to happen during warm-up.* Mubit spends
 *      its first seconds warming up; the request that lands there hangs
 *      and aborts. If `not_responding` escaped suppression, `◌ slow` would be the normal
 *      cold-start display and the ◍ glyph would be nearly unreachable — which inverts the
 *      whole point of §4.7 ("a user whose server is still starting must not be told memory
 *      is broken for fifteen seconds").
 *
 * `auth_failed` is the sole exception, and the suite pins it: §4.7 calls it sticky and says
 * it *pins* the status line. A server still warming up does not answer 401, so a 401
 * inside the grace window is a real verdict — and it is the one error the user can fix.
