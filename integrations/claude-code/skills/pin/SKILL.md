**This skill never installs anything.** It runs one Node process from the plugin directory,
which writes a run-scoped variable to the user's own Mubit instance. No packages, no services,
no changes to the shell.

## What a pin is

A pin is a sentence that is true for **this run and this task**, injected in full above the
recalled memory on every prompt until it is cleared.

> for the rest of this, don't touch the vendored server

The model is who notices a sentence like that. Before pinning existed, the only place to put
it was memory — so it was written as a *lesson*, and a lesson is durable and cross-session. It
would then be recalled into every future session of a project where it had long since stopped
being true. Removing that failure is the entire reason this command exists.

## Pin or remember — the line is not blurry

| | `/mubit-memory:pin` | `/mubit-memory:remember` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | this run, this task | durable, every future session |
| Ends when | the user clears it, or the run does | never, unless it is forgotten or superseded |
| Costs | tokens on **every** prompt of this run | nothing until recall decides it is relevant |
| Example | "no new dependencies while we finish this PR" | "this project pins dependencies by exact version" |

Read the two example rows before choosing. If the sentence would still be worth saying in six
months, in a different session, it is a lesson — use `/mubit-memory:remember`. If it would be
wrong to say next week, it is a pin.

## Pin something

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/pin.mjs" add "don't touch the vendored server" --data-dir "${MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}}" --run <run_id> --json
```

It renders on the very next prompt — the command writes through to the local cache the recall
hook reads, so there is nothing to wait for.

Use the user's own words. A pin is an instruction, and paraphrasing an instruction changes it.

### Always pass `--run`

`<run_id>` is the run named in the **Mubit memory is active** block at the top of this
conversation — the line reading `Run: cc-<slug>-<hash>`. Copy it verbatim.

Without `--run` the command has to guess, and it guesses by reading whichever run's hooks fired
most recently. Every Claude session on the machine shares one plugin data directory, so a
second session answering a prompt in the seconds before you type wins that race, and the pin
is written to *its* run. The command reports success either way. The user then watches for a
pin that renders in a session they are not looking at.

The command now refuses rather than guessing when two runs are live (`ambiguous_run` below),
but do not rely on that: it can only see the sessions whose hooks happen to have fired inside
its window, and passing `--run` is what makes the question not arise.

### And always pass `--data-dir`

**`--data-dir "${MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}}"` is not optional.** A Bash tool
call does not inherit `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` — it arrives empty — so without the flag the command
has to guess which of several `mubit-memory*` directories the host is using, and either
refuses with `no_run` or writes the pin through a store this session's hooks never read. The
host substitutes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` into this file before you read it, and the shell
default around it lets a session that pins `MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR` keep its pin — the same order
every hook resolves in. Pass the whole expression straight through. Do not turn it into an
`ENV=… node …` prefix: that is no longer a `node` command and will stop for a permission prompt.

## See what is pinned, and clear one

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/pin.mjs" list --data-dir "${MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}}" --run <run_id> --json
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/pin.mjs" clear <slug> --data-dir "${MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}}" --run <run_id> --json
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/pin.mjs" clear --all --data-dir "${MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}}" --run <run_id> --json
```

`list` prints a slug beside each pin; `clear` takes that slug. `--all` clears only this
plugin's pins and never another client's state in the same run.

**Clearing is half the job.** A pin that outlives the task it was set for is worse than no pin:
it is spending tokens on every prompt to enforce a rule that has stopped being true. When the
work a pin was set for is finished, say so and offer to clear it.

## The limits, and why they are there

At most **five pins**, each at most **200 characters**, and at most **240 tokens** rendered.
The command refuses anything over them rather than silently truncating.

They are tight on purpose. Recalled memory is ranked against the prompt and degrades to a
one-line pointer once the model has already seen it; a pin does neither — it is unranked and
paid in full on every single prompt of the run. Six standing constraints is not a set of
constraints, it is a document, and a document belongs in `CLAUDE.md`, where it costs nothing
per prompt.

If a refusal comes back, do not work around it by shortening the user's words. Report the cap
and ask which existing pin to clear.

## Exit codes

| Exit | Meaning | What to tell the user |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Done. `--json` carries `run_id` and the full pin list. | Confirm what is now pinned. |
| `1` | Refused or failed. `detail` says which. | Pass the detail on. A cap was hit, the run could not be determined, or the instance did not answer. |

Two failures worth recognising by name:

- **`unconfigured`** — no endpoint is set. Run `/mubit-memory:auth` first.
- **`no_run`** — no hook has written a run marker yet, so the command cannot tell which run
  this session is. It resolves itself after one prompt; `--run <run_id>` names one explicitly,
  and `/mubit-memory:doctor` prints the current run id.
- **`ambiguous_run`** — two or more runs are live in the shared data directory and no `--run`
  was given, so the command refused rather than pin to the wrong session. `detail` lists the
  candidates. Re-run with the run id from the SessionStart block; do not pick one from the
  list by guessing which looks right.

## What a pin is not

- **It is not a permission boundary.** It is text put in front of the model, exactly like
  recalled memory. Use Claude Code's permission system for anything that has to hold.
- **It is not stored offline.** A pin that the instance did not accept is not written locally
  at all, because a pin that exists only on one machine is one the user believes is shared and
  is not.
- **It does reach subagents.** `SubagentStart` puts the parent run's pins above its own,
  smaller recalled block, under a budget of its own, so a fan-out is told the constraint too.
