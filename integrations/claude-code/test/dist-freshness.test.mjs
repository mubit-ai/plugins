 * The committed bundles, against what this source builds.
 *
 * `npm test` runs `hooks/src/*.mjs`. The host runs the committed `hooks/dist/*.mjs`. Those are
 * two different files, and until this gate existed nothing compared them — so a bundle could be
 * arbitrarily far behind its source while the whole suite reported green.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical failure mode. It is how the sibling Codex plugin shipped launchers
 * writing `{"suppressOutput":true}` — a field Codex rejects at parse time — past 251 passing
 * tests, and a real user saw `• PostToolUse hook (failed)` twice per tool call. `hooks/dist` is
 * a committed artifact: whatever is committed is what runs.
 *
 * `test/helpers/dist-freshness.mjs` carries the machinery and the one narrowing this comparison
 * makes (inline sourcemap paths are relative to the output file, so they are normalised rather
 * than compared raw). `mcp/dist/server.js` is excluded because nothing in this checkout builds
 * it — it is vendored from a TypeScript sibling the generated mirror does not carry.
