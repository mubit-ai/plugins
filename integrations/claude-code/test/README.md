# Test suite — `mubit-memory`

**These tests were written before the implementation**, so the suite reads as a specification
rather than as a regression net: every failure names the file that does not exist yet, or the
manifest key that drifted, and says what defines it.

Each file is independently runnable and the whole suite finishes in well under ten seconds,
so the red-green loop stays tight.

## Running

```bash
cd integrations/claude-code

node --test 'test/*.test.mjs'     # everything
node --test test/redact.test.mjs  # one gate

npm run test:dist                 # everything, against the shipped bundles
```

Quote the glob so Node expands it. `node --test test/` fails before `package.json` exists —
Node treats the bare directory as a module path.

By default, hook tests run `hooks/src/*.mjs` so you can iterate without rebuilding:
`runHook()` resolves `hooks/src/<name>.mjs` unless `MUBIT_CC_TEST_TARGET=dist` (or a per-call
`target: 'dist'`) redirects it at the bundle `hooks/hooks.json` actually points at.

`npm run test:dist` is that redirect, and it is **enforced rather than a habit**:
`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs it as a step of its own, beside the pass against the
sources, so the code under test is the code a marketplace fetch hands a user. That second pass
is not redundant. A plugin is installed by fetching this repository — there is no install step
and no build — so the bundles under `hooks/dist`, `mcp/dist` and `bin/` are committed
artifacts, and esbuild can emit one that Node then refuses to import without anything about
the source looking wrong. Use the npm script rather than retyping the env var: that is what
keeps this file and CI from drifting into two spellings.

`.github/workflows/leak-scan.yml` is the other gate, and it asks a different question. This
repository is public, so that job scans for anything internal that should never have reached
it — and it is the last line rather than the first, since a leak it catches is already public.

Both are still worth running locally before you commit. The suite costs ~6 s, and CI is the
backstop, not the first line of defence.

No framework, no dependencies, no Docker, no real Mubit, and no network beyond loopback:
`fakeMubit()` is a real `node:http` server on `127.0.0.1:0` and hooks are real subprocesses
dialling it, so the client stack under test is the whole client stack. Nothing is monkey-patched
and nothing reaches the internet. `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`. The whole suite must stay
under ~10 seconds.

## Gate map

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `manifests.test.mjs` | manifests as data, version lockstep, allowlist ↔ the shipped MCP tool table |
| `hook-output.test.mjs` | the host's own output contract, over every registration in `hooks/hooks.json` |
| `mcp-surface.test.mjs` | real stdio `tools/list` against `mcp/dist/` — the allowlist as the model sees it |
| `mcp-instructions.test.mjs` | the server `instructions` field — the only steer a subagent gets |
| `mcp-egress.test.mjs` | what an MCP write puts on the wire: run scope, and the run id it cannot be talked out of |
| `engine-floor.test.mjs` | the Node floor guard — the failure where nothing loads and nothing says so |
| `state.test.mjs` | paths, atomic JSON, TTL pruning, markers, redacted logging |
| `config.test.mjs` | precedence, loopback detection, env tags, frozen defaults |
| `credentials.test.mjs` | the 0600 store, merge-not-replace, never throws |
| `auth.test.mjs` | the key ladder, PKCE + loopback, the four outcomes |
| `runid.test.mjs` | four strategies, the `source` table, never `"default"`, the mid-session `cd` |
| `redact.test.mjs` | patterns, denylist, caps, scrub-before-cap, self-reference |
| `breaker.test.mjs` | five states, "a timeout is not a verdict", half-open |
| `http.test.mjs` | pre-flight guards, never-throws, retry policy |
| `spool.test.mjs` | file-per-item under concurrency, lock stealing, `claimOnce`, the flush lease |
| `classify.test.mjs` | tool → intent table, never `unclassified`, lesson templates |
| `outcome.test.mjs` | the implicit outcome rule as a pure decision: the four cases, measured-`false` vs unmeasured, the derived key |
| `hook.test.mjs` | exit-code discipline, budgets, `spawnDetached` |
| `capture.test.mjs` | four modes, zero HTTP, one spool file, stable `item_id`, the Stop used-signal |
| `stage-prompt.test.mjs` | turn staging, the write race with `prompt-recall` |
| `pre-tool.test.mjs` | the rule store and its term matching, and — the load-bearing one — that **no path denies**: no `permissionDecision`, no `updatedInput`, exit 0, zero HTTP |
| `cwd-changed.test.mjs` | the run follows a mid-session `cd`; the run being left is drained, not orphaned |
| `drain.test.mjs` | batching, the 2xx/5xx/4xx split, idempotency, "ignored" vs "not injected" |
| `session-start.test.mjs` | the `source` table, sub-budgets, the offline steer block |
| `assemble.test.mjs` | section mapping and order, budget, `sourceRefIds` |
| `prompt-recall.test.mjs` | the three-rung ladder, policy cache, the `context` absence, the staged turn |
| `async-recall.test.mjs` | carry-forward recall: the detached refresh, who marks the seen-set, attribution on the receiving turn |
| `seen-set.test.mjs` | the cross-turn seen-set: what has already been paid for, and the degraded repeat |
| `subagent-start.test.mjs` | injection into a subagent, and the plugin's own agent excluding itself |
| `attribution.test.mjs` | `reference_id` → `entry_ids` end to end |
| `checkpoint.test.mjs` | redacted snapshot, spooled anchor, visible failure |
| `session-end.test.mjs` | the required reflect, once-marker, best-effort ordering, one outcome rule shared with `drain` |
| `session-end-detach.test.mjs` | the flush outliving the hook process: the hand-off, the order and the claim inside a detached child, the `reflect.status` table |
| `statusline.test.mjs` | network-free, glyph precedence, empty-state survival |
| `launch.test.mjs` | run-id derivation, env-before-import, allowlist default |
| `dashboard-data.test.mjs` | the local reader: run enumeration from `status/`, the redact-on-render path a `redact: false` cannot switch off, the tri-state `used` signal, and the rollup's cap and confinement |
| `dashboard-api.test.mjs` | the upstream proxy: `{record: false}` proved by the absent breaker file, the `id`/`lesson_id`/`reference_id` trap, the lessons↔activity join and its two ways of coming up empty |
| `dashboard-server.test.mjs` | the loopback server's nine invariants — 401 before any work, the key in no response, local routes offline, `safeSegment` on every id, typed-confirm delete, idle shutdown, `--stop` against a real detached child |
| `chrome-launch.test.mjs` | the browser helper's failed launch: the browser killed, its profile removed, and the file still able to exit |
| `skills.test.mjs` | frontmatter, tool prefixes, load-bearing prose |
| `failure.test.mjs` | the cross-cutting failure surface, twenty-nine cases end to end |

## `failure.test.mjs` is the important one

It was written first, and the reason generalises: the happy path is a handful of assertions,
but the failure surface is where the bugs live and it decides whether anyone keeps the plugin
installed.

Roughly a third of the whole suite exists to pin facts that are counter-intuitive enough that a
reasonable person would "fix" them in the wrong direction:

- **A 403 on the recall hook's first call is not a failure.** It is a policy verdict — cache it,
  descend the ladder, and leave the breaker and `auth_failed` untouched.
- **A timeout is not a verdict.** One `AbortError` changes no state.
- **A 401 must not open the breaker.** Hiding it behind a cooldown hides the only error the
  user can fix.
- **`claimOnce` returns `true` when it fails.** Losing a batch is worse than sending it twice.
- **One flush per session is two properties, not one.** `claimOnce` answers "already"; a
  lease answers "right now", so a second flush cannot start while one is in flight. It has to
  be a lease rather than a second marker so a killed flush blocks no later one.
- **The recall hook must never call `/v2/control/context` by default.** That call is the slow
  path on every prompt; the absence is asserted explicitly.
- **The `PreToolUse` hook must never deny, and exit 2 is a deny.** The host blocks the tool call
  on exit code 2 and lets every *other* non-zero code through, so the dangerous value is the one
  a naive error handler picks. `pre-tool.test.mjs` enumerates paths — flag off, empty store,
  corrupt store, unparseable stdin, underivable run id, unwritable data dir — and asserts exit 0
  and the absent keys on each, then greps the built bundle for the same, because the paths a test
  cannot reach are the ones the guarantee has to cover too.

When one of those fails, re-read the reasoning in the comment above it before changing the
assertion.

## The harness

`helpers/harness.mjs` — read it before writing a test.

- `makeDataDir()` — a fresh `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` with the data-directory skeleton.
- `makeProjectDir({git, branch, files})` — a real git repo when a run-id strategy needs one.
- `baseEnv({dataDir, endpoint, apiKey, extra})` — a fully pinned environment, so no test
  depends on your shell.
- `fakeMubit(routes)` — a `node:http` server on port 0 with canned replies, per-call arrays,
  `delayMs`, `hang`, and `assertCalled` / `assertNotCalled`. Unrouted requests are recorded and
  404'd, so "the hook called something it should not have" is always visible.
- `runHook(name, payload, opts)` — spawns a hook the way Claude Code does: fresh process, JSON
  on stdin, JSON on stdout.
- `assertHookContract(result)` — exit 0, stdout empty or parseable. True in every mode,
  including every failure mode.
- `lib('config.mjs')` / `mod('bin/statusline.src.mjs')` — cache-busting imports that fail with a
  pointed message when the module has not been written yet.

`fakeMubit()` unrefs its listening socket, so a test that fails before reaching
`await server.close()` cannot keep the process alive and hang the run. That matters more than
it sounds in a suite where every test fails by design. Closing the server explicitly — via
`t.after(() => server.close())` — is still the better habit, since it frees the port
immediately rather than at process exit.

`helpers/fixtures.mjs` holds the recorded stdin payloads and a `SECRETS` bundle of
realistic-but-fake credentials for the redaction tests. Use those rather than inventing new
credential-shaped strings.

## House rules

- **Which entry point a runner picks is not uniform, and the four rules are deliberate — say
  which one you are following when you add a runner.** `runHook()` takes `src` and is redirected
  wholesale by `MUBIT_CC_TEST_TARGET`, because a hook bundle is a faithful build of its source
  and either can answer most questions. `statusline.test.mjs` prefers the built
  `bin/statusline.mjs` and falls back to `src`. `launch.test.mjs` prefers `mcp/src/launch.mjs`
  and falls back to `dist`. `mcp-surface.test.mjs` is dist-only and hard-errors without the
  bundle — the *registered* tool table exists nowhere but the shipped server, which is how a
  broken tool table once shipped past a green suite.
- Table-drive anything that is specified as a table, one assertion per row.
- Comment each test with the property it protects, and why that property is worth a test.
- Never sleep for real windows. Shrink them with `MUBIT_CC_BREAKER_*`, `MUBIT_CC_BATCH_*`, and
  friends.
- Skip permission-based tests when running as root (`process.getuid?.() === 0`) — root ignores
  the mode bits those tests depend on.
