/**
 * `lib/activity.mjs` — the audit question, and the two places it can be answered dishonestly.
 *
 * This file is written around one distinction, because everything else here follows from it.
 *
 * **A listing is a claim the client makes. An export is a record the server holds.** When a
 * caller asks for non-derived entries and we print the answer under an `--exclude-derived`
 * heading, we are asserting something about the bytes on screen — not about a field we put in
 * a request. If the instance ignored the flag and we relayed the result anyway, we would have
 * manufactured a false compliance artefact, which is the exact failure this module exists to
 * remove. So the listing is re-filtered and re-projected here, and the corrections are
 * reported: "the server did not honour this" is itself audit-relevant.
 *
 * The export is the mirror image. `/v2/control/activity/export` takes neither
 * `exclude_derived` nor `projection`, so there is nothing to distrust, and `content` is
 * written out byte for byte. A compliance artefact the client reshaped is not a record of what
 * the server holds. The asymmetry is forced by the wire shape, and the tests below pin both
 * halves of it.
 *
 * The other load-bearing property is that **asking a question about your own data must not
 * take recall down**. `lib/http.mjs` records an abort as `not_responding` unless the caller's
 * deadline was tighter than the 4000 ms default — and both deadlines here are looser, so
 * without `{record: false}` five slow exports in five minutes would open the breaker and stop
 * recall and the capture drain. That is asserted on the absence of a breaker file rather than
 * on the presence of an option, because an option that is passed and silently dropped looks
 * identical at the call site.
