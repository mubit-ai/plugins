/**
 * `resumeBlock` — the briefing a session opens with.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is being claimed, and what would falsify it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `SessionStart` injects recalled memory; it has never injected *here is where you left off*.
 * The first prompt of a session is therefore answered against relevance matches to a question
 * the user has not typed yet, and resuming is the thing people actually want from a memory
 * layer. This feature assembles that briefing once per session, in a process nobody waits on,
 * and renders it above the ordinary recall block on the first substantive prompt.
 *
 * ```
 * session-start (blocking, ~300 ms)            session-resume (detached, up to 20 s)
 *   health → register → lessons
 *   spawn --run --agent ──────────────────────▶ postContext{mode:"sections"}
 *                                               writeResume → runs/<run>/resume.json
 *
 * prompt-recall (the first substantive prompt)
 *   takeResume  → render <mubit-resume> above <mubit-memory>
 *   markSeen    → before this turn's own recall assembles
 *   persistRecalled → the ids land on the turn that RECEIVED them
 * ```
 *
 * Five claims, and each has a group below:
 *
 *   1. **The session never waits for it.** `SessionStart` is a 5 s hook that Claude Code
 *      blocks on. A briefing worth 1000 tokens cannot be bought with the user's time, so the
 *      call happens in a second process and the hook's wall clock does not move.
 *   2. **The child is not a second derivation of the run.** `lib/runid.mjs` increments and
 *      *persists* `clear_count` on `source: 'clear'`; a second process re-deriving would hand
 *      itself `-c2` where the parent got `-c1`, write it back, and leave the briefing under a
 *      run nothing will ever read. Identity arrives on argv, exactly as `drain.mjs` takes it.
 *   3. **A background briefing cannot take recall down.** The one request it makes is
 *      `{record: false}`, so no verdict it collects reaches the breaker that `prompt-recall`
 *      and the capture drain both depend on.
 *   4. **Attribution and the seen-set land on the receiving turn.** Same rule, and same
 *      reason, as carry-forward: the process that assembles a block has shown nothing to
 *      anyone, so it records nothing about what the model saw.
 *   5. **Consumed once.** `takeResume` unlinks first and unconditionally, so a corrupt file
 *      cannot re-inject forever — and a slash command, which returns before any file is read,
 *      does not spend the briefing on a command addressed to the harness.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is not `lib/carry.mjs` with a second flag
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * With `recallAsync` on, `recall-refresh` writes `carry.json` after every prompt and
 * `takeCarry` unlinks it. Two detached writers on one path is a race whose losing outcome is
 * silent. Worse: if resume won, `carryForward` would render it through `wrap(…, carried=true)`,
 * which prints *"it was retrieved against the previous message in this conversation"* — a
 * factual lie about a block assembled before any message existed.
 * `resumeIsNotCarry` pins the separation at the path level.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `/v2/control/context`, and the two fields that are not on it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `/context` accepts no ranking field of any kind, and `lane_filter` is not one of its
 * fields either — that one belongs to `/query`. `entry_types` *is* accepted here and is worth
 * sending. `theRequestBodyIsTheResumeRequest` asserts all four absences by name,
 * each with the reason, because a field the server silently ignores while sitting in a
 * request log looking like a choice is a bug with no symptom.
 *
 * These tests are written before the implementation. Failing with
 * "lib/resume.mjs does not exist yet" is the expected red state.
