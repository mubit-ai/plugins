 * What the model is actually handed.
 *
 * Every other MCP test in this suite stubs the server out. `test/launch.test.mjs` swaps
 * `./server.js` for a module that snapshots `process.env`, which proves the launcher sets
 * `MUBIT_MCP_TOOLS` before the import — and proves nothing about whether anything reads it.
 * `test/manifests.test.mjs` reads tool names out of the bundle's *text*, which shows what is
 * **defined**, not what is **registered**. Between them there was no assertion that the
 * server a user runs answers `tools/list` with the ten tools the plugin configured. A server
 * that ignored the allowlist would pass both, and every session would carry schemas for
 * tools it never asked for.
 *
 * So this file speaks real stdio MCP to the committed `mcp/dist/index.js` and asserts the
 * surface itself. It is the only gate here that runs the shipped artifact end to end.
 *
 * Offline by construction — see `mcpListTools()` in `helpers/harness.mjs`. `tools/list` is
 * answered from the server's own table, so the endpoint is port 1 and nothing is dialled.
