/**
 * `lib/dashboard-api.mjs` — the dashboard's upstream proxy, and the three promises it makes.
 *
 * **An observer does not change what it observes.** `lib/http.mjs` settles every call into the
 * circuit breaker by default. A page polling a dead instance every fifteen seconds would
 * therefore open the breaker for the *hooks*: recall stops, the drain stops, and the status
 * line reports a failure the user caused by looking. Every call here passes `{record: false}`,
 * and the test for it asserts the absence of a breaker file rather than the presence of an
 * option — an option can be passed and ignored.
 *
 * **The key stays in the process.** No function returns `cfg`, and every message crossing the
 * boundary is scrubbed, because an upstream error carries a snippet of the response that
 * produced it and a proxy error page can quote a request header.
 *
 * **A dead instance is a banner, not a blank page.** Each function returns the same envelope,
 * so one shape maps onto an HTTP status, and the failures that have different fixes —
 * `auth_failed` versus `upstream_unreachable` — stay distinguishable.
 *
 * The wire-name trap has a test of its own. The server serialises `LessonEntry.id`; the
 * session-start hook reads `lesson_id`; `defaultRoutes()` in the harness fakes `lesson_id`.
 * The fake and a real instance therefore disagree, and code reading one spelling works against
 * exactly one of them. `lessonId()` accepts all three, and the table below covers all three.

 * A lesson's metadata may carry outcome counters — `success_count`, `reinforcement_count`,
 * `confidence`, `last_outcome` and friends — and `failure_count` / `partial_count` /
 * `neutral_count` appear only once such an outcome has landed. The plugin never read any of it. The census carries the metadata
