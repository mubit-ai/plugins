/**
 * `recallAsync` — the carry-forward recall path.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is being claimed, and what would falsify it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Recall blocks every prompt for up to `recallBudgetMs`, and the documented workaround for a
 * Mubit that answers in 1.4-2.3 s against a 1500 ms default is for the user to raise
 * `MUBIT_CC_RECALL_BUDGET_MS` by hand — which trades a truncated recall for a slower prompt.
 * `recallAsync` removes the trade: the hook renders a block the **previous** turn's detached
 * refresh left on disk and returns without dialling anything.
 *
 * Three claims, one test group each:
 *
 *   1. **Nothing changes for anyone who does not opt in.** The flag defaults to false, and
 *      with it unset the hook still dials on the turn and still injects on the turn. The rest
 *      of this suite's 929 assertions are the real proof of that; the one here is the
 *      structural half — no carry file, no refresh process.
 *   2. **Attribution is correct by construction.** The obvious worry about carrying a block
 *      forward is that the turn which receives it is not the turn that requested it. It is
 *      not so: the write happens on the synchronous *read*, against the prompt id in hand,
 *      so the ids land on the turn that was actually given them.
 *      `recalledLandsOnTheReceivingTurn` is the most valuable assertion in this file.
 *   3. **The wall clock stops tracking the endpoint.** Pinned against a real loopback server
 *      with `delayMs`, so no test sleeps and no test guesses.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why not `"async": true` in `hooks.json`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `hooks.json` does have a documented way to say "run this hook in the background without
 * blocking" — but it is a **static manifest field**. It cannot be conditioned on a runtime
 * config key, so a flag-gated `recallAsync` expressed
 * that way would need two registrations that no-op against each other: two processes per
 * prompt, forever, for everyone including people who never opt in. Carry-forward is
 * runtime-flippable, needs no manifest change, and is testable offline. Do not "simplify"
 * this into a manifest flag.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The seen-set interaction, which is the easy thing to get wrong
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `markSeen` records "the model has been shown this". Under carry-forward the refresh
 * *produces* the block and the next turn *renders* it, so there are two candidates for who
 * marks, and both wrong answers are silent:
 *
 *   - **The refresh marks** → a block that is never rendered (session ends, flag flipped off,
 *     compaction drops it) leaves entries recorded as seen that the model never received, and
 *     the next full-price block degrades them to pointers naming text that exists nowhere in
 *     the transcript. That is `lib/seen.mjs`'s own worst case.
 *   - **Nobody marks** → every carry-forward is assembled against an empty seen-set and the
 *     whole seen-set saving reverts, with no test failing.
 *
 * The answer is the synchronous reader, against the current run, *before* it spawns the
 * refresh — so the child's `readSeen` already contains this turn's ids. `refreshMarksNothing`
 * and `theRepeatDegradesOnTheTurnAfter` pin both halves.
 *
 * These tests are written before the implementation. Failing with
 * "lib/carry.mjs does not exist yet" is the expected red state.
