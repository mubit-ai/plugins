/**
 * `lib/credentials.mjs` — the store `/mubit-memory:auth` writes into.
 *
 * Why this module exists at all: `apiKey` is a `userConfig` key, and Claude Code keeps
 * `sensitive` userConfig values in the OS keychain. There is no API for a slash command
 * to *write* that keychain entry — the `/plugin` UI is the only writer. So a command
 * that obtains a key has nowhere to put it unless the plugin owns a store of its own.
 *
 * That store is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/credentials.json`, and the whole of its
 * contract is: it holds a live credential, so it is owner-only, and it never takes a
 * hook down.
 *
 * The mode assertions here are the point of the file. `0600` is not decoration — this
 * is the one file in the plugin that holds a secret at rest, and the two ways of
 * getting it wrong (chmod after write; writing into a file that already exists at a
 * wider mode) both leave a window where the key is world-readable and both look
 * completely fine in a passing round-trip test.
