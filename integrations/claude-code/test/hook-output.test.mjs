/**
 * `test/hook-output.test.mjs` — the HOST's hook-output contract, for every hook this plugin
 * registers.
 *
 * Every other hook test in this suite asserts the shape the plugin means to emit. This one
 * asserts the shape Claude Code actually accepts, and those are two different authorities:
 * the plugin decides what it means to say, the host decides what it is allowed to say,
 * and only one of them is holding the parser. Where they disagree the host wins **in silence**
 * — an output that fails its schema is discarded whole, so no `additionalContext` is injected,
 * no `systemMessage` is shown, and the hook still exits 0. Nothing downstream can tell that
 * apart from a hook that chose to say nothing.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A `checkpoint --post` that emitted
 * `hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName: "PostCompact"` had every re-anchor it produced thrown
 * away by the host:
 *
 *     PostCompact [node .../hooks/dist/checkpoint.mjs --post] failed:
 *     Hook JSON output validation failed — (root): Invalid input
 *
 * `PreCompact` never showed the problem, because it answers with `systemMessage`, which is a
 * top-level field and never reaches the `hookSpecificOutput` union at all.
 *
 * A per-hook test written against the plugin's own design cannot catch that class, because
 * the constraint does not live there. So this file is a gate over **every registration in
 * `hooks/hooks.json`** rather than over one hook: a new hook, or a new argv mode of an
 * existing one, fails here until it has a case, and the case then pins its stdout against the
 * host. `drain.mjs` is deliberately absent — it is spawned detached by other hooks, never by
 * the host, so nothing ever reads its stdout.
 *
 * The two host rules this encodes, both established against a running Claude Code rather
 * than taken from the published reference (the constants below record what it accepts):
 *
 *   1. `hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName` must be a name the host knows. Validation runs
 *      before dispatch, and a name outside the accepted set fails the WHOLE object.
 *   2. It must also equal the event that fired. Borrowing a neighbouring event's name is
 *      rejected outright — the host answers with an "incorrect event name" error naming the
 *      event it expected — never coerced, and never quietly let through.
 *
 * Together those are stronger than either alone: a hook registered on an event outside the
 * accepted set has **no `hookSpecificOutput` channel at all** — not under its own name, which
 * fails rule 1, and not under a borrowed one, which fails rule 2. Whatever it needs to inject
 * has to be delivered by a hook whose own event is accepted, or through a top-level field.
