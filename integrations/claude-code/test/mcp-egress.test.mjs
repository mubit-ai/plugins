/**
 * What an MCP write actually puts on the wire.
 *
 * Every other outbound call in this plugin goes through `lib/http.mjs`, which refuses a
 * poisoned run id and scrubs the body first. The MCP server is the exception:
 * it is a vendored bundle that dials the endpoint itself, and nothing in this repo saw the
 * request. Two things used to go out through that gap.
 *
 *   1. **Scope.** `mubit_learned` is the only write tool a default install exposes, and the
 *      bundled SDK hard-codes `lesson_scope: "session"` on it. `"session"` is not the
 *      per-run scope its name suggests — only `"run"` is — while the plugin promises the
 *      opposite in two places a user reads: `plugin.json` (`reflectOnEnd` — "the only path
 *      that promotes a lesson beyond its own run") and `skills/remember/SKILL.md`. The
 *      guard makes the wire match the promise.
 *
 *   2. **The run id.** Every write tool takes an optional `session_id`, so without the guard
 *      the run a write lands in is whatever the caller passed rather than the one the
 *      launcher derived.
 *
 * These tests assert on the **wire**, never on the mechanism: `mcpCallTool` runs the shipped
 * `mcp/dist/index.js` for real against a `fakeMubit` and hands back what it sent. A future
 * rebuild that fixes this upstream, or a different guard entirely, passes unchanged.
