 * The fact this file exists to protect: **two hooks post this outcome** — `drain.mjs` for a
 * turn that ended normally, `session-end.mjs` for a turn whose drain never reached it — and
 * for a while they disagreed about what to post. A run's outcome series then mixed two
 * definitions of the same measurement, with nothing on the wire to say which record came
 * from which. The rule lives here now so there is only one of it; the end-to-end proof that
 * both hooks agree lives in `session-end.test.mjs`.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of a turn object, so none of it needs a socket.
