/**
 * `hooks/src/prompt-recall.mjs` — UserPromptSubmit, blocking (§5.2, §1.8, §12.4).
 *
 * The single most counter-intuitive fact in the whole plugin, and the one a future
 * maintainer is most likely to "simplify" away:
 *
 *   | request                                       | LLM calls |
 *   | query{mode:"direct_bypass", evidence_only}    |     0     |  ← rung 1, the primary path
 *   | query{mode:"agent_routed",  evidence_only}    |     1     |  ← rung 2, only on a 403
 *   | context{mode:"sections"}                      |     2     |  ← rung 3, opt-in only
 *
 * `/v2/control/context` is not the cheap assembly path its name implies: it is the most
 * expensive of the three requests above, and the synthesized answer it pays for is one the
 * recall hook throws away. So the hook is query-first and treats `context` as the last rung
 * — the inverse of what the endpoint names suggest.
 *
 * These tests are written before the implementation. Failing with
 * "hooks/src/prompt-recall.mjs does not exist yet" is the expected red state.
