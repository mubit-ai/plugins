/**
 * `hooks/src/pre-tool.mjs` — PreToolUse, **warnings only** (stage 1: warn, never deny).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this gate is for
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A Mubit `rule` is defined as a hard constraint. Until now it landed as prose inside a
 * recall block, which the model may or may not honour. This hook is the first stage of
 * giving it a surface at the moment it applies — and **stage 1 denies nothing**.
 *
 * That is not a style preference, it is the whole safety argument for shipping it at all: a
 * false deny interrupts work, is confusing, and gets blamed on the plugin rather than on the
 * lesson that caused it. So the load-bearing test here is an *absence* test, and it
 * enumerates code paths rather than spot-checking the happy one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There are TWO ways to deny, and both are pinned below
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Both were established against a running Claude Code 2.1.235, the way
 * `hook-output.test.mjs` establishes its constants, rather than taken from the published
 * reference:
 *
 *   1. **stdout.** The "Expected schema:" block the host prints for this event admits a
 *      `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` of `allow`, `deny`, `ask` or `defer`, with a
 *      `permissionDecisionReason` beside it — and an `updatedInput`, which rewrites the
 *      tool's arguments and is a *larger* power than denying, since the call still runs and
 *      runs as something else. None of the five may ever appear.
 *
 *   2. **The exit code.** The host documents three bands for this event: exit 0 shows
 *      neither stdout nor stderr, exit 2 shows stderr to the model *and blocks the tool
 *      call*, and every other exit code shows stderr to the user only and continues with the
 *      call. **Exit 2 blocks the call.** Note the asymmetry: every *other* non-zero code
 *      continues through the normal permission flow, so the dangerous value is specifically
 *      2 — which is exactly what a naive `process.exit(2)` on an error path would pick.
 *      `lib/hook.mjs` pins `process.exitCode = 0` on every path out, and
 *      `assertHookContract` checks exit 0 as hygiene everywhere else in this suite; here it
 *      is the security property, so it is asserted explicitly and by name.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * And zero network, necessarily
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This hook runs in front of a tool call. It cannot dial: even a 30 ms round trip on every
 * `rm` is latency the user pays for a warning. Rules come off disk, from
 * `runs/<run_id>/rules.json`, which `session-start`'s lessons call and `prompt-recall`'s
 * ladder fill in passing from entries they already fetched. `fakeMubit`'s `assertNotCalled`
 * is what holds that: a real loopback server that records everything, so "it dialled" is
 * visible rather than inferred.
