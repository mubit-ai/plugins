/**
 * `lib/rank.mjs` — the prompt-shape rule behind `rank_by`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is being claimed, and what would falsify it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ask the plugin "where were we?" and recall answers with whatever is most **similar**.
 * A handoff question wants the most recent work instead, and `rank_by: "freshness"` is the
 * request field that asks for it. These tests pin the mode the client *sends*, which is the
 * only half the client owns.
 *
 * The rule that decides which of those two a prompt gets is the entire risk in this change,
 * and it fails in exactly two directions:
 *
 *   1. **Under-firing** — a real handoff question is ranked by similarity and the user gets
 *      last month's most-relevant lesson instead of yesterday's work. That is the bug we
 *      already have, so every common handoff phrase has a row below.
 *   2. **Over-firing** — the rule degrades into a substring match, fires on half of all
 *      prompts, and quietly re-ranks ordinary questions by recency. There is no error and no
 *      log line when this happens; recall just gets worse for everyone. The negatives are
 *      what stop it, and the sharp one is **"what's the latest version of esbuild"**: it
 *      contains `latest` and is not a handoff question at all.
 *
 * So: a `FRESHNESS` table and a `RELEVANCE` table, one assertion each, and the second table
 * is the load-bearing one. Deleting a row from it is how this rule rots.
 *
 * `'balanced'` is deliberately unreachable here — the rule is a two-way decision, and the
 * third mode exists only for an operator who sets it explicitly. `rankForRecall` is where
 * that precedence lives, and it gets its own group.
 *
 * These tests are written before the implementation. Failing with
 * "lib/rank.mjs does not exist yet" is the expected red state.

 *     resolved to `freshness`, half a dozen unrelated tests would start describing a
 *     different query than the one they mean to.
 *   - **Vetoed near-misses** contain a trigger word and are still not handoff questions.
 *     `latest`, `so far` and `current state` are the three ambiguous triggers, and each one
 *     is ambiguous in a specific, nameable way: `latest` points at someone else's release,
 *     `so far as` is the idiom "as far as", and `current state of the art` is a survey
