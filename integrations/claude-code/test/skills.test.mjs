/**
 * Skills and the subagent.
 *
 * A skill is markdown with YAML frontmatter, so it is testable as data. Two kinds of
 * assertion live here:
 *
 *   - Structural: every skill exists, the frontmatter parses, every `tools:` grant is
 *     fully qualified and names a tool that actually exists upstream. A malformed grant
 *     does not error at install time — it silently matches nothing.
 *   - Content guards: a handful of substring/regex checks over prose that protects real
 *     behaviour. Each one has a comment saying what goes wrong without it. These are not
 *     style checks; each guards a specific, observed failure mode.
 *
 * Frontmatter is parsed by a small local splitter — no YAML dependency, matching the
 * plugin's own zero-dependency rule.
