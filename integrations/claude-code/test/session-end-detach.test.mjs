/**
 * `hooks/src/session-end.mjs` — the flush has to outlive the hook process.
 *
 * Under test:
 *   - the ordered flow, unchanged, run somewhere the host cannot cancel it
 *   - `spawnDetached` — `detached: true`, `stdio: 'ignore'`, `unref()`, payload by file
 *   - `claimOnce` — one flush per session, so a session reflects once
 *   - reflect, the call that turns this session into lessons
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The fact this file exists to protect
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `POST /v2/control/reflect` is issued from exactly one place, and that place is a process
 * the host is free to take away. Under `--print` Claude Code emits its result and tears the
 * session down about a second into SessionEnd — a **cancellation**, not a timeout, so no
 * budget on either side of the boundary helps; a trial with `SessionEnd.timeout: 30` was
 * cancelled at the same ~1 s, four times out of four. Interactive sessions are cancelled too:
 * runs that demonstrably stored lessons still read `reflect: {at: 0, status: ""}`, because the
 * hook sent the request and was killed before it could say so.
 *
 * So the defect was never the reflect call and never a budget. It was that **all of
 * session-end's work lived inside a process with no right to finish**. The fix moves the body
 * into a detached child, which is what `test 1` below actually measures: the hook is SIGKILLed
 * mid-run and the flush is required to land anyway.
 *
 * Everything else here is the price of that move — the hand-off must be fast, must keep the
 * flow's order, must stay once-per-session, must be switchable off, and must fall back to running
 * inline when the hand-off itself cannot happen. The inline body is exercised verbatim by
 * `session-end.test.mjs`, which pins `MUBIT_CC_SESSION_END_DETACH=0` for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Tests pin the run id with the `static` strategy so `runs/<run_id>/` can be seeded
 * before the hook runs, and so the marker can be read at a known path afterwards.
