/**
 * `hooks/src/recall-refresh.mjs` — the detached half of carry-forward recall.
 *
 * Not registered in `hooks.json`, for the same reason `drain.mjs` is not: it is spawned
 * detached by `prompt-recall` when `recallAsync` is on, exactly the way `stage-prompt.mjs`
 * fires the drain. Nothing waits on it, and that is the entire point — it is the process
 * that pays for the round trip so the prompt does not.
 *
 * ```
 * prompt-recall (blocking, ~2 ms)          recall-refresh (detached, however long it takes)
 *   takeCarry  → render turn N's block
 *   markSeen   → record what turn N saw
 *   spawn ────────────────────────────────▶ readSeen (now including turn N)
 *                                           recallBlock (the same three-rung ladder)
 *                                           writeCarry → the block turn N+1 will render
 * ```
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this process must NOT do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It writes the **block** and nothing that describes what the model saw. Specifically, no
 * `markSeen` and no `recalled[]`:
 *
 *   - **`markSeen` here would be a lie.** It means "the model has been shown this", and this
 *     process has shown nothing to anyone. A block that is never rendered — the session ends,
 *     the flag is turned off, `checkpoint --post` clears it, the next prompt is a slash
 *     command — would leave entries recorded as seen that the model never received. The next
 *     full-price block then degrades them to pointers naming text that exists nowhere in the
 *     transcript, which `lib/seen.mjs` calls out as the one failure worse than paying twice.
 *   - **`recalled[]` here would credit the wrong turn.** The handoff's stated hard part was
 *     that "the turn that receives the block is not the turn that requested it". Writing
 *     attribution on the synchronous read instead of here dissolves it: the reader has the
 *     receiving turn's `prompt_id` in hand, so the ids land on the turn that was actually
 *     given them, by construction rather than by bookkeeping.
 *
 * It does own one thing the reader cannot: the **connection state**. This is the only process
 * that dials once the flag is on, so without its marker write the status line could never
 * show a failure again.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Budget
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `recallBudgetMs` is deliberately *not* consulted. That budget exists because a user is
 * waiting; here nobody is, so honouring it would reproduce the empty recall the mode was
 * built to fix — a Mubit answering in 1.4-2.3 s against a 1500 ms default is the runbook's
 * documented complaint. The bound here is `REFRESH_BUDGET_MS`, and `lib/http.mjs` still caps
 * each individual request at `timeoutMs`, so a hung endpoint costs one abandoned socket.
 *
 * Constraints shared with the rest of the plugin: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins,
 * and **exit code 0, always**.
