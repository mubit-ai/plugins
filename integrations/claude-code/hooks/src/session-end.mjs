/**
 * `hooks/src/session-end.mjs` — SessionEnd (§5.7).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the reflect call at the end of this file is not optional
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Mubit extracts lessons on its own as it ingests, but those keep the scope they were
 * extracted at, and a `run`-scoped lesson is invisible to the next session. Widening scope is
 * reserved for the explicit reflect path. So **`POST /v2/control/reflect` here is the only
 * thing in the entire system that lets a lesson outlive the run that produced it** (§1.4). It
 * is required, not optional, and `MUBIT_CC_REFLECT_ON_END=0` is an opt-out that knowingly
 * costs cross-session durability.
 *
 * It is also not sufficient: a lesson still has to establish itself before it travels, and
 * rules never travel at all. This hook therefore reports a count and claims nothing — a marker
 * promising durability would be a lie the user only discovers two sessions later, when the
 * lesson is not there.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Order is the whole design
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ```
 * claimHeld + lease → drain inline → flush outcome-pending turns → reflect → heartbeat idle
 *   → marker → claimOnce → release → pruneStale
 * ```
 *
 * **The drain commits before reflect is even attempted.** §1.4 says a session that ends
 * without reflecting loses scope promotion for that session's lessons — not the lessons
 * themselves — so a failing reflect may never be allowed to cost captures that were already
 * accepted. Outcomes go out before reflect for the opposite reason: `include_step_outcomes`
 * folds those signals into the evidence, and the negative ones produce the best lessons.
 *
 * The drain runs **inline within this body**, not as a further `spawnDetached('drain')`: one
 * hand-off is enough, and a second child would only race the first for the drain lock. It
 * ignores the batch-size trigger — there is no "next prompt" left to flush on.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ...and none of it runs in the process the host started
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The host does not promise this hook a chance to finish. Under `--print` Claude Code emits
 * its final result and tears the session down about a second in — a **cancellation**, not a
 * timeout, so no ceiling on either side of the boundary helps: a trial with
 * `SessionEnd.timeout: 30` was cancelled at the same ~1 s, four times out of four. Interactive
 * sessions are cancelled too, which is why runs that demonstrably stored lessons still read
 * `reflect: {at: 0, status: ""}` — the request went out and the hook was killed before it
 * could say so.
 *
 * So the ordered body above lives in a **detached child** (§4.9's `spawnDetached`, the same
 * mechanism `drain.mjs` already uses), and this process does exactly four things: stamp the
 * marker `handoff`, stash the payload, stamp it `detached`, spawn. The child is not on the
 * host's 8 s clock, because nothing is waiting on it.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - **The claim stays in the body, not in the parent.** A parent that claimed and then
 *     failed to spawn — or spawned a child that was reaped — would have burned the claim and
 *     taken the session's whole flush with it.
 *   - **The marker is stamped before the spawn**, so a fast child can only overwrite that
 *     stamp, never lose a race to it. The parent writes two non-terminal statuses and the
 *     child never writes either, which is what makes a marker left on one of them a specific,
 *     reportable failure rather than one more indistinguishable blank: `handoff` means the
 *     parent was killed before it could hand over or fall back — it dies inside the host's
 *     ~1 s window, so this is the common one — and `detached` means the hand-off completed
 *     and the child was reaped.
 *
 * `MUBIT_CC_SESSION_END_DETACH=0` runs the body here instead, for an environment that forbids
 * background processes; so does a hand-off that cannot be written. Neither drops the flush.
 *
 * SessionEnd can fire more than once (a `reason=exit` after a `reason=clear`, a wrapper
 * re-running the hook), and a double flush is a double reflect. Two things stop it, because
 * "already" and "right now" are different questions:
 *
 *   - `claimHeld`/`claimOnce` — has this session already been flushed. Read at the top,
 *     recorded at the bottom, so a flush killed in between leaves nothing behind and the
 *     next attempt picks the session up instead of standing down in front of undone work.
 *     `claimOnce` returns **true when it fails to write** — proceeding on marker failure is
 *     deliberate (§4.6): losing a session's captures is worse than sending them twice, and
 *     the batch carries the same `idempotency_key` whichever drainer sends it.
 *   - `acquireFlushLease` — is one flushing *right now*. That is exactly the question the
 *     split above cannot answer, and it has to be answered separately because reflect is not
 *     idempotent while everything else here repeats harmlessly. A lease rather than a second
 *     marker, so a killed holder blocks nobody: it is taken from a dead pid at once, and from
 *     a live one past its TTL.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout, and exit 0 always (§4.9). Anything still spooled is picked up by
 * the next session's first drain — the spool is keyed by `run_id`, not by session, so a
 * crashed session's captures survive.

 * milliseconds of it. In the detached child the ceiling stops applying the moment nothing is
 * waiting on us, so the body gets `drain.mjs`-class headroom for an LLM-backed reflect.
 *
 * The detached numbers are sized for the reflect below rather than for tidiness: they have to
 * leave `REFLECT_MS` intact *after* a full `DRAIN_MS` and the heartbeat reserve, because these
 * three compose and the innermost one binds. `hooks.json`'s `SessionEnd.timeout: 8` is
