/**
 * `hooks/src/drain.mjs` — the detached drainer.
 *
 * The only thing in the write path that touches the network, and the only caller in the
 * whole plugin that ever asks `lib/http.mjs` for `{retry: true}` — it is detached and
 * nobody is waiting on it, so one extra dial after a transport timeout costs nothing.
 *
 * Not registered in `hooks.json`. It is spawned only by `stage-prompt`, `capture --stop`,
 * `session-end` or `cwd-changed`, which is what keeps the per-tool-call hot path free of
 * node's startup cost a second time. The last of those passes `--run <id>`: it drains the
 * run a session has just walked away from, and a child that re-derived would read the
 * session map that hook is in the middle of rewriting. `stage-prompt` also passes
 * `--correct <prompt_id> --run <id>` when the user's prompt corrected the previous turn.
 * Nothing waits on it, so everything here must be safe to abandon:
 * one drainer at a time, one request per batch, and a spool that is only ever unlinked
 * after a 2xx.
 *
 * ```
 * acquireDrainLock → breaker check → readBatch(32) → POST /v2/control/ingest
 *   → 2xx      : commitBatch (unlink), marker.captured += n, push job_id into jobs.json
 *   → 5xx/net  : the batch is still good — LEAVE every spool file in place, stop
 *   → other 4xx: the payload is bad, not the server — quarantine in spool/rejected/
 *   → loop while items remain and elapsed < 10s → releaseDrainLock
 * ```
 *
 * **The three-way error split is the entire design.** A 5xx is the server's problem and the
 * batch is still good, so it is kept and retried next time. A 422 means the *payload* is
 * bad; retrying it forever is exactly how a spool becomes unbounded, so it is quarantined
 * and never retried. 408 and 429 are the two 4xx that stay retryable — and so, deliberately,
 * are 401/403/404: a user who has not pasted an API key yet, or a proxy that has not been
 * pointed at a Mubit build with these routes, must not have their memory deleted for it.
 *
 * **The lock is released on every exit path** — the breaker short-circuit, a throw after the
 * send, the hard stop — because a stuck `drain.lock` silently stops all capture for the
 * length of its 60 s TTL, which is far worse than the rare double drain that the per-batch
 * `idempotency_key` covers — it is content-addressed on `(run_id, item ids)`, so the same
 * items carry the same key whichever drainer sends them (`lib/spool.mjs`). The one
 * exception: a drainer that *lost* the race never deletes the winner's lock.
 *
 * Constraints, shared with the rest of the plugin: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins,
 * and **exit code 0, always**. A memory layer has no business breaking a prompt.
