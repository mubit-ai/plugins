/**
 * `hooks/src/session-resume.mjs` — the detached half of the resume briefing.
 *
 * Not registered in `hooks.json`, for the same reason `drain.mjs` and `recall-refresh.mjs` are
 * not: it is spawned detached by `session-start`, exactly the way `prompt-recall` fires the
 * refresh. Nothing waits on it, and that is the entire point — `SessionStart` is a blocking
 * hook the host holds the session open for, and a briefing that slow cannot be bought with
 * the user's time.
 *
 * ```
 * session-start (blocking, ~300 ms)             session-resume (detached, up to 20 s)
 *   health → register → lessons
 *   updateMarker
 *   spawn --run <id> --agent <id> ─────────────▶ resumeContext  (POST /v2/control/context)
 *   emit the steer block                         writeResume    → runs/<run>/resume.json
 *
 * prompt-recall, on the first substantive prompt
 *   takeResume → render above <mubit-memory>, markSeen, attribute
 * ```
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this process must never call `deriveRunId`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `lib/runid.mjs` is not a pure function. On `source: 'clear'` it increments `clear_count` and
 * **persists** the new SessionRecord (`lib/runid.mjs:155-159`), so a second process handed the
 * same payload does not merely recompute the parent's answer — it computes `-c2` where the
 * parent got `-c1`, writes it back over the parent's record, and leaves the briefing under a
 * run nothing will ever read. The next `/clear` then starts from a counter nobody set.
 *
 * So identity arrives on argv, `--run` and `--agent`, exactly as `drain.mjs` takes it from
 * `cwd-changed`. The payload still travels through a file, because `lib/hook.mjs`'s harness
 * needs a parseable object on the way in — but nothing in it is read for identity, and the
 * `clear` case is pinned by a test that drives this file with a `clear` payload directly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this process must NOT do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It writes the **block** and nothing that describes what the model saw: no `markSeen`, no
 * `recalled[]`, and — unlike `recall-refresh` — no marker write either.
 * `recall-refresh.mjs:22-31` argues the first two at length and the argument is stronger here:
 * a carried block is rendered on the very next prompt, while a briefing has a whole session's
 * worth of ways never to be rendered at all. The session can end without a prompt, the first
 * prompt can be a slash command, a compaction can clear it. Recording entries as seen that the
 * model never received is `lib/seen.mjs`'s own worst case.
 *
 * The marker is the third, and it is where this file differs from its twin. `recall-refresh`
 * owns the connection state because with `recallAsync` on it is the *only* process that dials;
 * here `prompt-recall` is still dialling on every prompt and still writing `state`, so a
 * second writer would add nothing but a race — and the `recall` group it would land beside
 * describes what was *injected*, which this process does not do.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Budget
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `recallBudgetMs` is deliberately not consulted, for the reason `recall-refresh` gives:
 * that budget exists because a user is waiting, and here nobody is. The bound is
 * `lib/recall.mjs`'s own 20 s request deadline plus room for the write, and that request
 * carries `{record: false}` so nothing it learns can reach the breaker.
 *
 * Constraints shared with the rest of the plugin: zero dependencies, Node >= 20 built-ins,
 * and **exit code 0, always**.
