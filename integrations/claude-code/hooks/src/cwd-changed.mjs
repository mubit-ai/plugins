/**
 * `hooks/src/cwd-changed.mjs` — CwdChanged, the run-id follower.
 *
 * `per-directory` is the default run strategy: the run id is derived from a directory, so a
 * session that changes directory changes run. `lib/runid.mjs` now reads `payload.cwd` and so
 * derives the right answer on its own — but deriving a new id is only half of what a move
 * needs, because **nothing in this plugin ever sweeps `runs/`**. `session-end.mjs` and
 * `drain.mjs` each scope to exactly one run, and that run is this session's current one. If
 * the id simply moved, the run the session left would keep a spool nobody was ever going to
 * send: it survives only if the user walks back into that repo before `pruneStale` deletes it
 * (24 h), and it never gets a reflect, so its lessons never widen past `run` scope.
 *
 * So this hook is the moment of the move, and it does three things with it:
 *
 *   1. Nothing at all, when the run did not move. `cd src/` is the ordinary case and it must
 *      cost nothing — the id resolves through `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so only a
 *      different repo moves it, and `per-conversation` and `static` never move at all.
 *   2. Drains the run being left, pinned with `--run` so the detached child cannot re-derive
 *      through the mapping this hook is rewriting.
 *   3. Marks the run being entered, because `bin/statusline.mjs` follows the session map on
 *      every frame and renders `''` until the marker it names has been written.
 *
 * **Three host facts, undocumented in the published hook reference and observed live on
 * Claude Code 2.1.235:**
 *
 *   - `CwdChanged` has **no `hookSpecificOutput` channel** — the same class as `PreCompact`
 *     and `SessionEnd` — so anything it said there would pass validation and then be
 *     discarded in silence. Every path here returns `{suppressOutput: true}`; the effect is
 *     entirely in the writes.
 *   - The payload names are `old_cwd` and `new_cwd`, not `previous_cwd`.
 *   - It supports no matcher, and it fires *after* the directory has already changed, so it
 *     cannot block one.
 *
 * `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is deliberately **not** written, though the host does republish it on this
 * event. It is sourced as a shell script for Bash-tool commands; no hook process re-reads it,
 * and neither does the already-running MCP server. `MUBIT_CC_RUN_ID` is consulted only under
 * `runStrategy: static` — which no `cd` can move — so a republish would be inert under the
 * default and misleading under the pin.
 *
 * **Failure:** swallow everything. The cost of an unwritable data dir here is one
 * mis-attributed run, which is exactly the cost of not having this hook at all.
