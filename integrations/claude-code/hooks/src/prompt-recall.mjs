 * `hooks/src/prompt-recall.mjs` — UserPromptSubmit, blocking.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is here, and what moved
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The three-rung read ladder — and the counter-intuitive fact that
 * `/v2/control/context` is the *most* expensive rung rather than the cheapest — lives in
 * `lib/recall.mjs`, because it now has more than one caller. Read that file's header before
 * touching anything about which request gets made.
 *
 * What is left here is the part that is specific to a *user prompt*: deciding whether this
 * prompt is worth recalling against at all, deriving the run, and then writing down what the
 * injection cost and what it named so `Stop` can attribute against it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The cross-turn seen-set
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Recall fires before every prompt with no relevance gate, and six memories about the task
 * at hand do not stop being about the task at hand on the next prompt. So the same entries
 * were re-rendered, and re-paid for, on every prompt of a session — up to 1500 tokens each
 * time, against 356 tokens *once* for the entire MCP tool surface.
 *
 * This hook now reads `runs/<run_id>/seen/<session_id>.json` (`lib/seen.mjs`) before
 * assembling and marks it after, beside the ids it stages on the turn. A repeat is
 * **degraded, not dropped**: it renders as a pointer and keeps its `reference_id` in
 * `recalled[]`, because dropping it would break attribution for exactly the memories that
 * are helping most. The set is one conversation's, keyed by the host `session_id` beside the
 * run: a second session in the same directory has seen none of it, and a payload with no
 * session id reads an empty set and marks nothing.
 *
 * Two consequences that are easy to get wrong, both pinned by tests:
 *
 *   - **Mark only what was rendered.** A failed or empty recall marks nothing, or the next
 *     prompt points at a memory the model was never given.
 *   - **A pointer's words are not memory vocabulary.** `memoryTerms` excludes pointer lines,
 *     so a degraded turn lands in `lib/outcome.mjs`'s *unmeasured* row rather than its
 *     *injected-and-ignored* row. See the note on `memoryTerms`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Carry-forward, when `recallAsync` is on
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * With the flag set this hook stops dialing. It renders the block the PREVIOUS turn's
 * detached `recall-refresh` left in `runs/<run_id>/carry.json`, marks it seen, spawns the
 * refresh that will produce the next one, and returns — a couple of milliseconds, whatever
 * the endpoint is doing. `recallBudgetMs` stops being a number anyone has to discover.
 *
 * Two things about it are worth stating before someone "simplifies" them:
 *
 *   - **It is not `"async": true` in the manifest.** That field is real — Claude Code 2.1.235
 *     describes it as "if true, hook runs in background without blocking" — but it is a
 *     *static* manifest field and cannot be conditioned on a config key. A flag expressed
 *     that way needs two registrations no-oping against each other, which is two processes
 *     per prompt for everyone, including the people who never opted in. See `lib/carry.mjs`.
 *   - **Attribution is correct by construction, not by bookkeeping.** The write happens here,
 *     on the synchronous read, with the *receiving* turn's `prompt_id` in hand. Nothing has
 *     to remember which prompt asked for the block.
 *
 * The order below is load-bearing: render, then `markSeen`, then spawn. `markSeen` is
 * synchronous and the child's `readSeen` happens a node boot later, so the refresh always
 * assembles against a set that already contains this turn's ids. Spawn first and the repeat
 * is not degraded on the next turn — the seen-set saving silently reverts, with nothing red.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Pinned context
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A pin is a standing constraint the user set for this run — "for the rest of this, don't
 * touch the vendored server". It is read from `runs/<run_id>/pins.json` (`lib/pins.mjs`) and
 * rendered by `wrap`, and three properties of that are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - **It costs zero HTTP requests.** `readPins` is one `readJson`. The network half runs in
 *     the detached drainer, which is why a pin can render inside this hook's 1500 ms budget
 *     and, more to the point, while the breaker is open.
 *   - **It renders where recall does not** — `recall: false`, a prompt under 8 characters, an
 *     open breaker, a failed recall, an empty result, no carried block. Recall is a ranked
 *     guess about what might be relevant; a pin is an instruction, and the turns where recall
 *     finds nothing are exactly the turns where the instruction is all there is. The two gates
 *     that stay closed are a slash command (addressed to the harness, not the model) and an
 *     unconfigured install (no endpoint, and no run id worth deriving a subprocess for).
 *   - **It is not memory.** Pins never enter `outcome.refIds`, so they never reach
 *     `recalled[]` or the seen-set: there is no `reference_id` to attribute a turn to, and a
 *     standing constraint degraded to `(seen earlier)` is a constraint that does nothing.
 *
 * Their cost is recorded as `recall.pin_tokens`, beside `recall.tokens` rather than inside it.
 * Folding them together would corrupt every recall-cost measurement the plugin has taken.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The resume briefing
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * On the first *substantive* prompt of a session — past the length gate and past the slash
 * gate — this hook also renders the block `hooks/src/session-resume.mjs` assembled while the
 * session was starting, **above** the ordinary recall block. It is a file read, exactly like
 * carry-forward, and it is consumed once per session.
 *
 * All of it lives in three functions: `claimResume` takes and marks, `resumeWrap` renders,
 * `injection` decides the order. Reading those three, in that order, is the whole feature from
 * this side; `lib/resume.mjs` has the rest.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Budget and failure
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1500 ms internal (`MUBIT_CC_RECALL_BUDGET_MS`) against a 3 s hook timeout, on a hook that
 * fires before EVERY prompt. Rung 2 is skipped when under 500 ms remains: it is the slower
 * rung, and starting one that cannot finish spends the time and injects nothing.
 *
 * Breaker-open, a timeout, an empty result or any non-2xx all emit exactly
 * `{"suppressOutput": true}`. Injecting "I found nothing" wastes tokens and teaches the
 * model to distrust the channel. The hook never blocks and never exits non-zero.

/**
 * The whole of the flag's synchronous half: read one file, render it, record it, start the
 * refresh that fills the file again. No socket, no deadline, nothing that can time out.
 *
 * The four steps happen in this order and the order is not incidental:
 *
 *   1. **`takeCarry` consumes.** A block is injectable exactly once. A refresh that stops
 *      answering must not leave the last good block to be re-injected on every prompt for
 *      the rest of the session (`lib/carry.mjs`).
 *   2. **`persistRecalled` against THIS `prompt_id`.** This is where the handoff's stated
 *      hard part goes away: the ids are staged by the process that just handed the block to
 *      the model, so they land on the turn that received it. `Stop` then reinforces exactly
 *      the memories that were in front of the model when it answered.
 *   3. **`markSeen`, before the spawn.** It is synchronous; the child's `readSeen` is a node
 *      boot away. Do it after the spawn and the refresh assembles against a stale set, the
 *      repeat is re-sent in full next turn, and the whole saving reverts with nothing red.
 *   4. **Spawn, unless the breaker is open.** A block already on disk is rendered either
 *      way — it cost a round trip nobody should pay twice — but the breaker's rule still
 *      holds for the dial: no process per prompt against a server already known to be down.

/**
 * Take this session's briefing, and record that the model is about to be shown it.
 *
 * Three decisions live in these few lines and each of them is silent when it is wrong.
 *
 *   1. **The renderer marks, not the assembler.** `hooks/src/session-resume.mjs` writes the
 *      block and nothing that describes what the model saw, for the reason
 *      `recall-refresh.mjs:22-31` gives at length: a process that has shown nothing to anyone
 *      must not record entries as shown. That argument is stronger for a briefing than for a
 *      carried block — a carried block is rendered on the very next prompt, while a briefing
 *      has a whole session's worth of ways never to be rendered at all.
 *   2. **It marks BEFORE this turn's recall assembles.** `readSeen` runs a few lines below, so
 *      an entry that is in both renders in **full** in the briefing above and as a **pointer**
 *      in the recall block below. That is accurate rather than merely cheap: the briefing
 *      really is earlier in the same message, so the pointer's promise — "this was injected in
 *      full earlier" — is true. Mark after the assembly instead and the same 200 tokens are
 *      sent twice in one message, with nothing red.
 *   3. **The gate is on the read as well as on the write.** An operator who turns the feature
 *      off gets it off on the next prompt, rather than after whatever a previous session
 *      already staged has been spent.
 *
 * `takeResume` is consume-once and total, so this is safe to call on every prompt for the
 * whole life of a session: the second call and every one after it answer `null`.

 * "Active rules" reads with the authority of a project invariant, and the model will act on
 * a year-old one rather than look. One sentence is the whole fix.
 *

 * a memory without carrying it reads exactly like a memory that was truncated, and a model
 * that reads it that way will either ignore it or invent the rest. Roughly twenty tokens to
 * make the other ~180 legible; on a block with nothing degraded it is not spent at all.
 *
 * A carried-forward block says *that*, too, and only under `recallAsync`. It was retrieved
 * against the previous message, so without the line the model reads a block about the last
 * question as an answer to this one — and quietly concludes that recall is unreliable rather
 * than that it is one turn behind. One turn of staleness is the mode's whole cost; stating it

 * those things — the user typed it a minute ago and it is true until they clear it. A model
 * that reads the caveat as covering the pin will second-guess a standing constraint, which is
 * the exact opposite of the point. Above it is the only placement where it does not.
 *
 * The caveat, the carried-block note and the pointer note are all conditional on there being
 * a recalled block at all, because on a pins-only turn each of them describes an absence.
 *
 * The one clause that separates the two renders only when recalled memory follows: it is
 * ~15 tokens spent telling them apart, and on a pins-only turn there is nothing to tell apart.
 *
 * **Not in `lib/assemble.mjs`.** Three reasons, each sufficient. `assembleContext`'s contract
 * is that it reproduces what the server's rung 3 would render, and a client-only section
 * inside it breaks that. Under `recallAssemble: server` rung 3 never passes through it, so
 * pins would silently vanish for those users. And inside it a pin would be subject to the
 * seen-set — a pin degraded to `(seen earlier)` is a pin that does nothing.
