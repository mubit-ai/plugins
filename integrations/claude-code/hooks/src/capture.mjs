/**
 * `hooks/src/capture.mjs` — PostToolUse / PostToolUseFailure / PermissionRequest / Stop /
 * StopFailure / SubagentStop (§5.4).
 *
 * One script, six modes by argv: none, `--failure`, `--permission`, `--stop`,
 * `--stop-failure`, `--subagent`.
 *
 * `--permission` is Codex-only, because `PermissionRequest` is an event Claude Code does not
 * have. See `buildPermissionItem` for why it earns a mode of its own rather than riding on
 * the ordinary tool path.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The two properties that dominate this file
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. **Zero network, ever.** Capture runs on every single tool call. Its only outbound work
 *    is `spawnDetached('drain')`, and only when a trigger fires. That is what makes
 *    "detached" cheap: re-spawning yourself detached on every `PostToolUse` pays node's
 *    startup twice per tool call, so instead capture is pure local I/O — one file write,
 *    well under the §5.4 budget of 40 ms wall.
 *
 * 2. **Every item carries an `intent`.** The server classifies cheaply when an item
 *    arrives with an intent set, and otherwise falls back to an LLM round trip *per item*.
 *    An item without an
 *    intent is not a cosmetic problem, it is a bill — at tool-call frequency it is the
 *    difference between a plugin you leave on and one you uninstall.
 *
 * §5.4's pipeline, and every step of it individually try/caught so that a redaction crash
 * drops the item rather than spooling it unredacted:
 *
 *   config -> self-reference -> denied path -> classify -> build text -> redact
 *          -> appendItem -> maybe spawn drain -> emit {"suppressOutput": true}

/**
 * The tools worth no memory. §3.2's matcher used to be an allowlist of eleven built-in tool
 * names, which is a rule this plugin cannot keep correct: the host owns that set and renames
 * it under us (`Task` -> `Agent`, `KillShell` -> `TaskStop`, `BashOutput` -> `TaskOutput`).
 * What kept the allowlist working at all was the host's own legacy-alias table — it tests a
 * matcher against a tool's current name AND its former ones, so `Task` went on quietly
 * matching `Agent` long after the rename. That is a compatibility shim the plugin does not
 * control, cannot see, and is one host release away from losing. Everything the allowlist
 * had never heard of was dropped in the manifest, silently, with nothing to report the loss.
 *
 * So `hooks.json` now matches every tool and the decision lives here, where a test can reach
 * it — and it is a *deny* list, so a tool that does not exist yet is captured by default.
 * Each row, and why it is not an episode:
 *
 *   TodoWrite        the model rewriting its own checklist. The plan that matters is in the
 *                    turn itself, which `Stop` already stores.
 *   EnterPlanMode    a mode transition, and so is its twin below. The plan they bracket was
 *   ExitPlanMode     written by the turn; the transition itself carries none of it.
 *   ToolSearch       loading a tool's schema. It says what was looked up, never what was done.
 *   ListAgents       who happens to be running right now; stale the moment it is stored.
 *   TaskList         likewise an enumeration of current state, not a change to it.
 *   CronList         likewise.
 *   Monitor          a poll. One wait becomes fifty identical items at recall time.
 *   ScheduleWakeup   a timer being set. Whatever it wakes up to is the episode, not this.
 *   StructuredOutput the plumbing by which a subagent hands its result back. The result is
 *                    already captured — at that subagent's `SubagentStop` — so storing this
 *                    too buys a duplicate of the most-duplicated content there is.
 *
 * **Kept on purpose**, because each records a decision or a result rather than bookkeeping:
 * `AskUserQuestion` (see below), `ReportFindings` (the findings ARE the content),
 * `CronCreate`/`CronDelete` (durable config mutated — the same shape of act as `Write`),
 * `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` (they decide where every later `Edit` lands, so an episode
 * that omits them misreads), `LSP` (code intelligence — read-shaped, exactly like `Grep`),
 * and `Workflow`. Absence from this list is the default; a name earns a row here only with a
 * reason written next to it.
 *
 * `AskUserQuestion` is the one that looks like bookkeeping and is not, so it gets its own
 * paragraph: its `tool_response` carries **what the human chose, and the options they turned
 * down**. §4.5 already grades it `feedback` — "the one entry type that records what the
 * human, not the model, decided" — and that is precisely the class of fact a model cannot
 * re-derive by reading the codebase, which is the whole reason a memory layer exists. It was
 * on this list in an early draft only because, before the `tool_response` fix, the payload
 * looked empty. Do not tidy it back on.
 *
 * Applied to SUCCESSFUL calls only, for the same reason self-reference suppression is
 * (step 2 below): a failure is the highest-value thing a coding agent can remember (§4.5),
 * and "the todo write blew up" is a diagnostic nobody else is keeping.

/**
 * PermissionRequest (Codex only): `"<tool>(<params>) NEEDS APPROVAL"`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is an item at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A permission request looks like half a fact — it says a gated call was *attempted* and
 * never says what the human answered. That reads like a reason to drop it, and it is
 * exactly backwards.
 *
 * When the user **allows** the call, `PostToolUse` fires and records the whole episode, so
 * this item is redundant and cheap. When the user **denies** it, no `PostToolUse` ever
 * fires — observed live against a real session — and this is the only trace anywhere
 * that the attempt happened. "We tried this and were not allowed to" is precisely the class
 * of fact a model cannot re-derive by reading the codebase, and without this mode a coding
 * agent rediscovers the same forbidden operation once a session, forever.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a mode of its own rather than the ordinary tool path
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three things differ, and each would be wrong on the tool path:
 *
 *   1. **There is no `tool_response`.** `buildToolItem` would render `Tool(params) -> ` with
 *      nothing after the arrow, which is the exact string that made every early memory this
 *      plugin shipped useless.
 *   2. **The intent is `feedback`, not `tool_output`.** §4.5 grades `feedback` as "the one
 *      entry type that records what the human, not the model, decided", and a request for
 *      approval is a question put to a human. Grading it as tool output files it with the
 *      file reads.
 *   3. **There is no `tool_use_id`.** Codex's `permission-request.command.input` has no such
 *      field, so the stable id has to come from the fallback hash. Two identical requests in
 *      one turn therefore dedupe to one item, which is the right answer: they are the same
 *      question asked twice.
 *
 * `medium`, not `high`: a gated call is a routine event under `dontAsk`, and grading every
 * one of them `high` would outrank the failures that §4.5 reserves `high` for.

/**
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The used-signal — what it can show, and what it cannot
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Recall injects on every prompt over 8 characters. The cost of that is measured; whether
 * any of it was *read* is not, and this hook cannot answer that question — the plugin sees
 * what the model said, never what it attended to. So this does not claim to measure use. It
 * measures one observable proxy and records the raw ingredients of it:
 *
 *   **did the reply carry vocabulary that came from the injected block and not from the
 *   prompt?**
 *
 * The prompt subtraction happens in `prompt-recall.mjs`, and it is the only reason the
 * number is worth anything: retrieval matched the prompt in the first place, so an overlap
 * with the prompt's own words is what you would see with the memory layer switched off.
 *
 * No score is emitted, deliberately. A ratio over a term list of arbitrary size has no
 * calibration behind it, and a `0.4` would be read as one. What is recorded is the matched
 * terms, the size of the set they were drawn from, and the method's name — the ingredients
 * any later calibration would need, and none of the confidence it has not earned.
 *
 * **Its weaknesses, in order of how often they will bite:**
 *
 *  1. *False negatives dominate.* A model that reads "never run the migration twice" and
 *     then simply does not run it twice has used the memory perfectly and echoed nothing.
 *     Rules and prohibitions are the entries most likely to be used silently, which is
 *     exactly the class this signal is worst at.
 *  2. *Only the final message is visible.* Memory used in intermediate reasoning or in a
 *     tool call it prompted is invisible here; `Stop` carries the last message and no more.
 *  3. *False positives from shared subject matter.* Memory and reply are both about this
 *     codebase, so a term can coincide without the memory having been read.
 *  4. *Paraphrase defeats it entirely.* The match is lexical, with a left word boundary
 *     only — `poll` matches `polling` — and nothing beyond that.
 *
 * **What it would take to falsify it:** a few dozen turns where a human reads the injected
 * block and the reply and judges "used / not used", scored against `used_evidence.used`. If
 * the two distributions do not separate — if the signal fires about as often on turns a
 * human calls unused as on turns they call used — the method is noise and belongs deleted,
 * not tuned. Tightening a threshold on a signal that has never been checked against a label
 * is how this codebase acquired a 400 ms health budget that failed every trial it was given.
 * Until that check exists, nothing may gate recall on this: it is a measurement, not a
 * verdict, and `drain` treats it as one.
 *
 * §4.4: nothing from the reply is written down. The record carries only terms that
 * `prompt-recall` already staged and already scrubbed, so a secret the assistant happened to
 * print cannot land here — the reply is read, matched against, and dropped.
