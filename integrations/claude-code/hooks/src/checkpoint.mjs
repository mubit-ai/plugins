/**
 * `hooks/src/checkpoint.mjs` — PreCompact (`--pre`, blocking) / PostCompact (`--post`).
 *
 * One script, two modes by argv, and they have almost nothing in common: `--pre` is the only
 * blocking network call in the plugin, `--post` is a file read and a log line.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why blocking is justified here and nowhere else
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every other hook in this plugin would rather lose a memory than cost the user a
 * millisecond, because the content it is trying to capture is still on disk afterwards.
 * `PreCompact` is the single event where that is false: once the host compacts, the transcript
 * this hook was handed is **gone**, and nothing later can reconstruct it. §5.6 therefore
 * spends a 5000 ms internal budget against the 10 s `hooks.json` timeout, and §5.6's failure
 * line is the one failure in the whole plugin the user is shown:
 *
 *     mubit: checkpoint failed (server_error) — pre-compaction context not saved
 *
 * It is still exit 0 (§4.9). Blocking is not the same as failing, and a memory layer never
 * gets to fail a compaction.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The §5.6 flow, and the two places this file deviates from its step numbering
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. read `transcript_path` — the LAST 200 KB of message text
 *   2. redact it, before it goes anywhere
 *   5. spool the `checkpoint`-intent summary item        <- moved ahead of step 3
 *   3. POST /v2/control/checkpoint
 *   4. persist {checkpoint_id, token_estimate, at} to runs/<run_id>/checkpoints.json
 *
 * **Step 5 runs before step 3 on purpose.** §5.6 calls the spooled item the thing that makes
 * the anchor survive "even if the checkpoint call itself failed" — and the checkpoint call
 * can fail in a way a 500 does not cover: by hanging until the harness deadline fires and
 * takes the rest of the body with it. A local file write that happens first survives that;
 * one queued behind the socket does not. The item pays for it by carrying the `label` rather
 * than the server-assigned `checkpoint_id`, which is the cheaper half of the pair — the label
 * is derived here and is enough to join the two records back together.
 *
 * The **transcript is the densest secret surface the plugin ever touches** (§4.4): it holds
 * every command that was run and every file that was pasted. So the tail is scrubbed before
 * it is put in a request body, before it is put in a spool file, and before it is put in a
 * log line — and a scrub that throws drops the snapshot entirely rather than sending it raw.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `--post` injects nothing, and the re-anchor ships from SessionStart instead
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * §5.6 gives `--post` (800 ms, **zero network**) the job of telling the model what the anchor
 * is and how to ask for it. It cannot do that job, and it never could: Claude Code validates
 * `hookSpecificOutput` against a closed set of `hookEventName` values, `PostCompact` is not
 * one of them, and a name outside the set fails the **whole** output —
 *
 *     PostCompact [node …/hooks/dist/checkpoint.mjs --post] failed:
 *     Hook JSON output validation failed — (root): Invalid input
 *
 * — so every re-anchor this hook emitted was discarded, silently, on every compaction since
 * the first release. `--pre` was never affected because `systemMessage` is a top-level field
 * and never reaches that union. `test/hook-output.test.mjs` holds the accepted set and the
 * gate that now covers every hook.
 *
 * So the re-anchor moved to `hooks/src/session-start.mjs`, which fires with
 * `source === "compact"` after a compaction and whose `SessionStart` name **is** accepted. It
 * reads the same `checkpoints.json` this hook writes, so nothing new is stored to carry it.
 *
 * What is left here is a log line naming the anchor a compaction happened against — cheap,
 * useful when a user asks why nothing was re-anchored, and the honest amount of work for a
 * hook with no channel to speak on. With nothing stored it says nothing at all: "checkpoint
 * undefined holds your context" is strictly worse than silence, and so is a payload the host
 * throws away.

 * a memory that exists nowhere in the conversation — the model is told a memory applies and
 * is given no way to read it, which is strictly worse than having paid full price for it.
 *
 * Only this session's file goes. The set is keyed by conversation, and another session in
 * the same run still has its transcript, so its pointers are still true; a payload with no
 * session id names no file and clears nothing.

 * no stored anchor still emptied the window; gating the reset on `--pre` having succeeded
 * would leave stale pointers behind on exactly the runs that already lost their checkpoint.
 *
 * Emits `{"suppressOutput": true}` on every path, including the one that found an anchor. See
 * the header: `PostCompact` has no `hookSpecificOutput` channel, so the only shapes available
 * here are a top-level field or silence — and `systemMessage` is reserved (§5.6) for the one
 * failure that loses data, not for a routine note after every compaction. The model gets the
