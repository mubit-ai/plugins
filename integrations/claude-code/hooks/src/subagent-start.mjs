/**
 * `hooks/src/subagent-start.mjs` — SubagentStart, blocking (§5.2, §4.3).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this hook exists at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **`UserPromptSubmit` does not fire for a subagent.** Measured on Claude Code 2.1.235,
 * over one parent turn that fanned out to two parallel general-purpose subagents:
 *
 *     2 SubagentStart / 2 SubagentStop / 1 UserPromptSubmit
 *
 * The single `UserPromptSubmit` was the parent's. So `prompt-recall` — the whole of the
 * recall path — is inert inside the Agent tool, and until this hook existed every subagent
 * a user spawned worked with no injected memory whatsoever. Not a small block: none.
 *
 * The other half is that this event can do something about it. The host's own registry says
 * "Exit code 0 - JSON additionalContext shown to subagent", and a live subagent asked where
 * it had seen an injected token answered: in a system message of its own, **prefixed by the
 * host with `SubagentStart hook additional context: `**, delivered in the same envelope as
 * the deferred-tool and skills listings.
 *
 * That prefix is the host's. `wrap()` below does not repeat it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One caveat that can make this hook buy nothing
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The host drops the collected context outright when the agent runs with its own isolated
 * context. Budget spent on such an agent is spent and discarded. Nothing in the payload
 * distinguishes those agents, so the honest handling is to say so in the guide rather than
 * to pretend otherwise in code.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three ways this is NOT `prompt-recall` with a different event name
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ladder itself is not here — it is `lib/recall.mjs`, which owns all three rungs and
 * the counter-intuitive fact that `/v2/control/context` is the *most* expensive of them.
 * Read that file's header before changing which request goes out. What is here is only what
 * a *subagent* needs, and each of the three differences below reads like a simplification:
 *
 * 1. **The query cannot come from the payload.** `SubagentStart` carries `session_id`,
 *    `transcript_path`, `cwd`, `prompt_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_type`, `hook_event_name` —
 *    and no task text at all. No `prompt`, no `description`. It does carry the *parent's*
 *    `prompt_id`, so the query is read back out of the turn `stage-prompt.mjs` staged on the
 *    parent's `UserPromptSubmit` (§5.3). No staged turn means no query, and no query means
 *    no request: dialling on the agent type alone would search for a word the user never
 *    typed, once per spawn.
 *
 * 2. **The parent's seen-set is neither read nor written.** `lib/seen.mjs` degrades a repeat
 *    into `(seen earlier) <ref> — <clause>`, which asserts the model was given the entry in
 *    full earlier *in this conversation*. For a subagent that sentence is false: it has a
 *    fresh window and was given nothing. A pointer would name a memory and withhold its
 *    text, which is strictly worse than not injecting it. Marking is the same mistake
 *    pointing the other way — the parent never received this block, so recording it as shown
 *    would make the parent's next prompt point at text it was never given.
 *
 * 3. **The budget is smaller.** `subagentRecallTokenBudget` (600) against the parent's 1500.
 *    A subagent's window is smaller and its task narrower, and this is paid once per spawn:
 *    a fan-out of ten pays it ten times.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The parent's pins, which are not recall
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A pin is a standing constraint the user set for this run — "for the rest of this, don't
 * touch the vendored server" — and until this hook read them a subagent inherited none. The
 * reason was structural rather than deliberate: pins render inside `prompt-recall`, and
 * `UserPromptSubmit` does not fire for a subagent.
 *
 * That is the worst place for a constraint to go missing. A fan-out of ten is ten agents
 * doing work, none of them told, none of them watched, and every one of their outputs
 * accepted by the parent.
 *
 * It costs nothing to fix: `readPins` is one `readJson` and a string join — no socket, no
 * subprocess — so it sits inside this hook's budget with room to spare. The only real
 * decision was the cap. `MAX_PIN_TOKENS` is 240, which is 16% of a parent's 1500 and **40%**
 * of the 600 here, so `lib/pins.mjs` carries a second, measured constant and this hook asks
 * for it by name.
 *
 * Pins render where recall does not, exactly as in `prompt-recall`: `recall: false` turns
 * *recall* off and is not a switch for "inject nothing ever", and a failed query, an absent
 * parent turn or an empty result are all reasons to have retrieved nothing and none of them
 * is a reason to withhold a constraint that came off local disk.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two things deliberately absent
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **No breaker pre-check.** `prompt-recall` reads the breaker itself because it blocks every
 * prompt and because it owns the marker's `state`. Neither applies here: `lib/http.mjs`
 * consults the breaker on its own way to the socket, so an open breaker already costs this
 * hook a `failure` Outcome and no round trip.
 *
 * **No marker write.** `status/<run_id>.json` is last-write-wins per run and is what the
 * status line renders as `recall 6/1.2k tok` for the *parent's* prompt. A subagent
 * overwriting that group would attribute its own numbers to the parent's turn — six spawns
 * would leave whichever finished last. The per-subagent record below is the read-out
 * instead. This is the one rule `prompt-recall`'s pin path does not share: its `pinsOnly`
 * stamps `pin_tokens` on the marker, and doing the same here is precisely the attribution
 * error above, so the pin spend goes on the sub-run record with everything else.
 *
 * §4.9 throughout: never blocks, never exits non-zero. The only thing a failure here costs
 * is the memory.

 * Why a file, and why it says `linked: false`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Mubit's subagent-isolation pattern is for an orchestrator to give each subagent its own
 * `run_id` and join them with `link_run()`, reading them back with `include_linked_runs`.
 * **This client cannot do that half.** `lib/http.mjs`'s `ROUTES` exposes health, register,
 * heartbeat, ingest, query, context, outcome, checkpoint, lessons and reflect — and no
 * link-run route. Inventing an endpoint would be worse than the gap: writing a subagent's
 * evidence under an id nothing can rejoin would *lose* it rather than isolate it.
 *
 * So the isolation is local for now, and the record is the thing that makes the gap
 * recoverable later rather than lost: it holds both ends of the join (`sub_run_id`,
 * `parent_run_id`), the two agent ids, and the ids this subagent's block actually rendered,
 * so a later `link_run` has everything it needs without a rerun. `linked: false` states the
 * gap in the data rather than leaving a reader to infer it from an absent field.
 *
 * `agent_transcript_path` — per-subagent, and the one field that could anchor a real
 * sub-run — arrives on `SubagentStop`, not here, so it is not in this record. It is where
