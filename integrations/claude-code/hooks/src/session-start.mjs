/**
 * `hooks/src/session-start.mjs` — SessionStart (blocking, injection only).
 *
 * Matchers `startup|resume|clear|compact|fork`. **Budget 2500 ms internal against a 5 s hook
 * timeout**, with three sub-budgets: health half the envelope, register 600 ms, lessons
 * 900 ms. Missing a sub-budget degrades *that section only* — a slow lesson list costs the
 * lesson list, not the steer block. The one thing this hook may never do is fail to speak:
 * Claude Code waits for it, and a session that starts with nothing injected is a session where
 * the model has no idea memory exists.
 *
 * On `source === "compact"` it also carries the post-compaction re-anchor. That belongs to
 * the checkpoint flow and used to ship from `checkpoint --post`, where the host discarded it on every
 * compaction: `PostCompact` is not a `hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName` Claude Code accepts,
 * and `SessionStart` is. See `hooks/src/checkpoint.mjs` and `test/hook-output.test.mjs`.
 *
 * The flow:
 *
 *   1. `loadConfig`; with capture AND recall both off there is nothing to say and nobody to
 *      say it to — emit `{}` and dial nothing.
 *   2. `deriveRunId` honouring the `source` table (that module owns the whole table,
 *      including `/clear`'s counter and the session-map write).
 *   3. `marker.cold_start_until = now + coldStartGraceMs` — the grace window starts
 *      here, so a server still starting up does not read as "memory broken".
 *   4. `GET /v2/core/health` @`HEALTH_MS`. Not ok → skip 5-6 but **still steer**, saying memory
 *      is offline. Without that the model invents recall or apologises for its absence.
 *   5. `POST /v2/control/agents/register` @600 ms — or `/heartbeat` on `resume` and `fork`,
 *      because re-registering an agent that never left is only noise.
 *   6. One page of `POST /v2/control/activity` @900 ms — lesson entries, full projection,
 *      newest first — filtered to `global` scope here. It sends **no `run_id`** on purpose: a
 *      lesson another run widened past its own is the entire point of the section, so scoping
 *      the request to this run would return nothing on a brand-new one. The route takes no
 *      scope field, so the filter is client-side and the page is large.
 *   7. Assemble `additionalContext`, update the marker, emit — and, on `startup` and `resume`
 *      only, spawn the detached `session-resume` that assembles the resume briefing the first
 *      substantive prompt will render. Nothing here waits on it; `spawnResume` says why.
 *
 * The steer block does two jobs. It names the run and the mode, and it tells the model **when
 * to search and when not to**: recall is injected before every turn, so opening turn one with
 * a recall call is pure cost — but when the injected block falls short, searching is the right
 * move and the block names which tool for which shape of question.
 *
 * That balance is the fix for a defect this block used to carry on its own. It said only "do
 * not search for it preemptively" — a negative with no positive beside it — while the MCP tool
 * descriptions said nothing about when to use them either. Between them the trained behaviour
 * was to never call any memory tool at all, which made every measurement of those tools a
 * measurement of this paragraph. Change the two together or neither.

/**
 * The last act of the flow: fire `session-resume` and forget about it.
 *
 * The whole feature turns on this call being fire-and-forget. `SessionStart` is a **blocking**
 * hook — Claude Code holds the session open for it, with a 5 s host timeout and a 2500 ms
 * internal budget — and the briefing costs a `/v2/control/context` round trip, which is slow
 * and has a 20 s deadline. Awaiting any part of it here would open every session in the
 * world on a stalled hook, and would blow the budget often enough that the *steer block* would
 * start going missing too. `test/session-resume.test.mjs` pins the wall clock against a
 * `/context` that never answers.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Only `startup` and `resume`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `SessionStart` fires on five sources and three of them already have the answer:
 *
 *   - **`clear`** asks for a blank slate and `lib/runid.mjs` gives it one — a brand-new run id
 *     with nothing under it. There is no "where we left off" to describe, and dialling for one
 *     is a slow round trip to be told so.
 *   - **`compact`** is re-anchored for free a few lines above: the checkpoint id `checkpoint
 *     --pre` stored does the same job with no round trip and against a transcript that is
 *     actually there.
 *   - **`fork`** continues a conversation that is already in the model's window, so the
 *     briefing would describe context it can still read.
 *
 * That leaves the two where the window is empty and the run has history — which is exactly
 * what "resume" means, whichever of the two words the host used.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the identity goes on argv
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `--run` and `--agent`, the same handoff `cwd-changed` makes to `drain`. The child may not
 * re-derive: `deriveRunId` increments and persists `clear_count` on a `clear` source, so a
 * second process would produce `-c2` where this one produced `-c1` and write it back. The
 * payload rides along only because `lib/hook.mjs` needs a parseable object on stdin; nothing
 * in it is read for identity.
 *
 * A briefing that could not be started costs this session its summary and nothing else.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, any>} cfg
 * @param {Record<string, any>} payload
 * @param {string} runId
 * @param {string} agentId
