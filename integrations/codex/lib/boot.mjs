/**
 * `lib/boot.mjs` — the env-before-import shim, and the only file in this plugin that is more
 * than two lines long.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a shim exists at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The shared modules capture their configuration at **module scope**. `lib/config.mjs`
 * resolves `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and the data directory when `loadConfig` first runs, and the
 * bundled MCP server reads `MUBIT_DEFAULT_SESSION_ID` in a top-level `const`. So a value set
 * *after* the shared module is imported is indistinguishable from a value never set at all.
 *
 * Codex exports none of the names those modules read. Probed against a live 0.146.0 hook
 * process, all four of `PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`,
 * `PLUGIN_DATA` and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` arrive unset — the strings exist in the binary, but
 * are only ever populated for plugin-sourced hooks, and plugin-sourced hooks do not load.
 * There is no `${...}` substitution layer either: a `$PLUGIN_ROOT` written into a hook
 * command is expanded by the login shell Codex runs it in, to the empty string.
 *
 * So something has to synthesise them, and it has to do it first. This is the same ordering
 * rule `mcp/src/launch.mjs` already lives by — its whole reason for existing is that every
 * `process.env` write happens before `await import('./server.js')` — and `codex-boot.test.mjs`
 * guards it here the way `test/launch.test.mjs` guards it there.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it fills in, and from where
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | name                 | source                                | why not the environment |
 * | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
 * | `MUBIT_CC_HOST`      | the constant `codex`                  | declared, never sniffed — see below |
 * | `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | the nearest `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` above this file | Codex sets no plugin root of any spelling |
 * | `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` | whichever `~/.claude/plugins/data/mubit-memory*` this machine's Claude Code install uses | deliberately the **same** directory, suffix and all |
 * | `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | the payload `cwd`, else `process.cwd()` | Codex runs a hook in the project directory |
 *
 * **The host is declared, not detected**, and that is a correctness decision rather than a
 * shortcut. A Codex session launched from a Claude Code terminal inherits `CLAUDECODE=1` and
 * a dozen `CLAUDE_CODE_*` variables; a Codex session from a plain shell has none of them.
 * Any sniff gets one of those two cases wrong, silently. This file can assert the answer
 * because it exists nowhere else: if this module is running, the host is Codex.
 *
 * **The data directory is the one that looks like a mistake and is not.** A Codex session and
 * a Claude Code session in the same directory derive the same run id — that is the point of
 * the port — so they must also read and write the same directory. A Codex-only user does end
 * up with a `~/.claude/` directory they never asked for, and `README.md` says so. The
 * alternative is one project with two memories that never meet, which is the failure the
 * shared run id exists to prevent.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. A hook is on the user's critical path, and a shim that fails should
 * cost the memory rather than the turn: every fallible step is caught, and a name it could
 * not resolve is simply left for the shared module's own fallback to answer.
 *
 * Zero dependencies: Node built-ins only, and nothing imported from the shared plugin. That is
 * deliberate — this module runs before the shared modules are allowed to load, and importing
 * one to ask it a question would be the very ordering mistake the file exists to prevent.

 * `hooks/dist/impl/<name>.mjs`, where `import.meta.url` names the *output* file and the root
 * is three levels up. An installed copy under `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/…` is the bundled
 * layout again, at a path nothing here can predict.
 *
 * The marker walk answers all three, and answers a fourth case the depth arithmetic could
 * not: a test importing this module directly, where `process.argv[1]` is the test runner.
 *
 * `argv[1]` is the fallback rather than the primary for that reason, and it is bounded the
 * same way. It is right whenever the process was started by Codex — every registered hook is
 * `hooks/{src,dist}/<name>.mjs`, exactly two levels down — and wrong only where the marker
 * walk has already succeeded.

/**
 * The data directory a Claude Code session on this machine actually uses.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a search and not a constant
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `lib/state.mjs` defaults to `~/.claude/plugins/data/mubit-memory`, and that default is only
 * ever reached when the host did not set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` — which, under Claude Code, it
 * always does. **The name the host picks carries a suffix**: a marketplace install writes
 * `mubit-memory-<marketplace>`, a `--plugin-dir` session writes `mubit-memory-inline`, and the
 * bare name is only one of several. `scripts/mubit-inspect.mjs` has known this for as long as
 * it has existed; this file did not, and assumed the bare name.
 *
 * The consequence was silent and complete. A Codex session derived the *same run id* as the
 * Claude Code session in the same directory — the sharing worked — and then wrote it into
 * `…/mubit-memory` while Claude Code read `…/mubit-memory-mubit`. Two memories of one project,
 * one of them missing the credentials, and nothing anywhere reporting it. Measured on a real
 * install: both directories held a run named `cc-mubit-plugin-testing-41703b8c`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The preference order, and why each rung
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. **A directory holding `credentials.json`.** `/mubit-memory:auth` writes exactly one of
 *      these, into the install the user actually authenticated. It is the strongest available
 *      evidence of which install is live, and it is the one that makes the credentials the
 *      user already has work under Codex without copying anything.
 *   2. **The most recently modified.** Every hook touches its data directory, so recency is a
 *      good proxy for "in use" when nobody has authenticated yet.
 *   3. **The bare name**, created if absent. A machine with no Claude Code install at all is
 *      the ordinary case for a Codex-only user, and it wants a directory rather than an error.
 *
 * A search is still a guess, so it is a fallback and not the mechanism.
 * `scripts/setup.mjs` resolves the same thing at install time and **pins** it as
 * `MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR` in the registrations it writes, which outranks everything here — so on
 * a set-up install this function is never consulted at all.
 *
 * `liveDataDir()` in `integrations/claude-code/lib/state.mjs` is the same algorithm, copied
 * rather than shared. This module is loaded unbundled at runtime by `scripts/setup.mjs`, and
 * the codex package ships only its own `lib/`, so an import across integrations here would be
 * a dead path in the published plugin. Keep the two in step by hand.
