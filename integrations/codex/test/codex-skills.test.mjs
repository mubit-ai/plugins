/**
 * The skills, as data.
 *
 * Codex reads a skill's frontmatter for two fields and nothing else. There is no
 * `allowed-tools` anywhere in the 0.146.0 binary and no `tools:` grant — the string does not
 * exist — so a Claude Code skill copied across carries a key that grants nothing and reads
 * like a guarantee. What Codex does instead is list every skill's `name` and `description` to
 * the model up front and let it read the `SKILL.md` on demand, which makes the description
 * the entire routing decision.
 *
 * The second gate is the tool prefix. Under Claude Code the plugin's tools are
 * `mcp__plugin_mubit-memory_mubit__<tool>`; under Codex they are `mcp__mubit__<tool>` — the
 * server name, from `.mcp.json`, and nothing else. A skill telling the model to call a tool
 * name that does not exist is worse than one that says nothing: the model tries, fails, and
 * concludes the memory is broken.
 *
 * Everything here is structural or a content guard over prose that protects real behaviour.
 * Each guard has a comment saying what goes wrong without it; none of them is a style check.
