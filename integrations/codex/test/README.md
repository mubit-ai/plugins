# Test suite — `mubit-memory` for Codex

**These tests were written before the implementation**, so the suite reads as a specification
rather than as a regression net. Every failure names the file that does not exist yet, or the
manifest key that drifted, and says what defines it.

The same house rules as `../../claude-code/test/README.md`: `// @ts-check`, a header comment
naming the claim each file defends, a `// §` comment above each test, assertion messages that
state the *consequence*, and absences asserted explicitly (`server.assertNotCalled(...)`,
`assert.equal(server.requests.length, 0)`) rather than inferred from timing.

## Running

```bash
cd integrations/codex

node --test 'test/**/*.test.mjs'          # everything
node --test test/codex-payload.test.mjs   # one gate

npm run test:dist                         # everything, against the committed bundles
```

The six `codex-*-cli.test.mjs` files spawn the **committed** `bin/<name>.mjs` through
`test/helpers/codex-cli.mjs`, with an environment built from nothing — no `MUBIT_CC_HOST`,
no `CLAUDE_*` — because that is what a skill-run command gets. They never import the shared
`bin/*.src.mjs` in-process: that path cannot go red on a bundle that boots without the shim.

**Both suites are one change.** `lib/`, `hooks/src/` and `mcp/src/` live in
`../claude-code` and are shared, so anything touching them has to be green in both:

```bash
cd ../claude-code && npm test    # 1829
cd ../codex       && npm test    # 434
```

## The load-bearing trick

`test/fixtures/observed/payloads/*.json` are payloads **the host itself wrote**, into a
recorder hook, during a real session. `codex-payload.test.mjs` checks every fixture against
them, and every hook's stdout against the output contract.

The reason is worth stating, because it is why this suite is arranged differently from its
sibling: **a fixture written beside an implementation cannot falsify that implementation.**
Whatever shape the code reads, the fixture will have — the two are written by the same person
in the same hour, and they agree by construction. Nine tests can pass on a payload Codex would
never send. A payload the *host* wrote can say no.

What a recording cannot do is prove a field optional, or reject one the host would accept but
has not been seen sending. And five of the eleven events do not fire in a scripted one-turn
session, so they have no recording at all — `codex-payload.test.mjs` names them rather than
passing over them, because a gap nothing states is indistinguishable from coverage.

It has already earned that twice. The first draft of `preCompact()` carried a
`permission_mode` — the two compaction events are the only turn-scoped events without one — and
`permissionRequest()` carried a `tool_use_id`, which it has none of, and which is precisely why
that event is treated as read-only.

Re-record with `node test/helpers/codex-record.mjs --update`. It costs a model turn, which is
why it is a script you run deliberately rather than something the suite does.

## Gate map

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `codex-manifests.test.mjs` | manifests as data: exactly the eleven events, no `if:` predicates, no `args` exec form, every command naming a committed bundle, version lockstep with the Claude Code plugin, and the absences — no `hooks`, no `mcpServers`, no `userConfig`, no `agents/`, no status line |
| `codex-payload.test.mjs` | every fixture and every hook's stdout against the host's own extracted schemas |
| `codex-boot.test.mjs` | env-before-import: what the shim fills in, what it refuses to overwrite, and the ordering assertion over every entry point |
| `codex-hooks.test.mjs` | end to end, one per event: real subprocess, real Codex payload, the emitted `hookEventName`, and zero HTTP where the contract says zero |
| `codex-runid.test.mjs` | the cross-harness claim — one directory, two harnesses, one run — the four-value `source` table, and `turnKey` |
| `codex-transcript.test.mjs` | `checkpoint.mjs`'s reader on a rollout fixture: same rendering, redacted, a real tail, and the Claude Code envelope still working |
| `codex-classify.test.mjs` | `shell`, `apply_patch`, `update_plan`, `view_image`, `web_search`, `collaborationspawn_agent`, `mcp__mubit__*` → real intents, never `unclassified` |
| `codex-skills.test.mjs` | Codex frontmatter (`name`, `description`, and none of the keys Codex does not read), `mcp__mubit__` prefixes, and the content guards |
| `codex-mcp.test.mjs` | real stdio `tools/list` against the committed bundle, the `instructions` frame, and that the two copies of the vendored server are byte-identical |
| `codex-failure.test.mjs` | unparseable stdin, absent env, unwritable data dir, a misbehaving endpoint, hostile payloads, the three-second SessionEnd → exit 0, a JSON object on stdout, **never exit 2** |
| `codex-file-change.test.mjs` | the structured file-change lane on a real `apply_patch`: add/update/delete from the markers, the merged per-run index, a `.env` patch dropped whole, no `files` on a shell command, and the ingest body after `Stop` |
| `codex-handoff-cli.test.mjs` | the committed `bin/handoff.mjs`, spawned with no host in its environment: the sender is `codex`, the default action, the client-side open join, feedback, and the three refusals by name |
| `codex-import-cli.test.mjs` | the committed `bin/import.mjs`: the default source is the Codex rollouts, a dry run dials nothing, `--send` tags `tool:codex` with the live item id, a re-run sends nothing, both sources, and the reviewer thread and injected preamble skipped |
| `codex-pin-cli.test.mjs` | the committed `bin/pin.mjs`: the `variables/*` bodies, the cache the hooks read, a failed write leaving nothing, the run from the marker or `--run`, never the key, and the store setup pinned found with nothing on the command line |
| `codex-activity-cli.test.mjs` | the committed `bin/activity.mjs`: rows on stdout and the summary on stderr, `--jsonl`, an export that owns stdout and writes no file, `--run`, and never the key |
| `codex-admin-cli.test.mjs` | the committed `bin/admin.mjs`: the census through `/activity` and never the lessons route, a checkpoint verbatim, the SessionEnd reflect body, exit 2 without dialling, and an unconfigured install told to run `auth` |

## `codex-failure.test.mjs` is the important one

Codex reads a hook's exit code exactly as Claude Code does: 0 parses stdout, **2 blocks** and
turns stderr into the reason shown to the model, anything else is an error surfaced to the
user. So the dangerous value is the one a naive error handler picks — a memory layer that threw
would start denying tool calls, and the user would experience it as the agent refusing to work.

Two Codex-specific failures get their own tests because neither has a Claude Code counterpart
and both are silent:

- **A registered hook that is not trusted never runs**, with no prompt and no warning. Nothing
  a hook can defend against — but the plugin must not be confusable with "capture is off", so
  every path leaves a local marker and `mubit-memory:doctor` reads it.
- **`SessionEnd` gets three seconds**, clamped by the host whatever the registration says, where
  the same hook asks for eight under Claude Code. One case asserts the hook *returns* inside it
  and another that the detached child finishes the work after the hook process is killed.

## The harness

`helpers/codex-fixtures.mjs` — read it before writing a test.

It re-exports `../../claude-code/test/helpers/harness.mjs` wholesale, bound to this plugin's
root, and adds two things of its own: one builder per Codex event, and a small draft-07
validator plus the schemas to run it against. There is deliberately no second copy of
`makeDataDir` / `fakeMubit` / `runHook` / `assertHookContract` — the spawn protocol, the fake
server and the contract assertions are identical across the two hosts, and a fork of them would
be a second thing to keep true.

`rolloutJsonl()` builds a Codex rollout transcript, envelopes and all, for the checkpoint tests.

## House rules, in addition to the sibling's

- **Assert against the fenced blocks when a skill must not *run* something, and against the
  prose when it must *say* something.** A string that must never be executed is very often a
  string the prose ought to name explicitly and warn about; a flat substring search cannot tell
  "do not write `${X}`" from "write `${X}`", and pushes the skill towards saying nothing.
- **Say when a fixture was not observed.** `preCompact` and `postCompact` were never reached by
  the probe — a probe turn is far too small to compact — so they are built from the extracted
  schemas alone, and the builder's docblock says so. A fixture whose provenance is unstated
  reads as recorded when it was inferred.
