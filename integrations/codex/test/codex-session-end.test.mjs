/**
 * `session-end` when the user has turned the detached hand-off off.
 *
 * `sessionEndDetach: false` is a supported setting, and it is the configuration in which this
 * hook does its work inside the process Codex started. Two things made that configuration
 * lose the work silently.
 *
 * **The budget was sized for the wrong host.** The inline deadline is 6800 ms, which sits
 * inside Claude Code's `SessionEnd.timeout: 8`. Codex clamps SessionEnd to **3 s** whatever
 * `hooks.json` asks for — recorded against a live host and asserted by
 * `codex-failure.test.mjs` — so 6800 ms is 2.4× the ceiling. Worse, the sub-budgets nested
 * inside it (`DRAIN_MS` 3500, `REFLECT_MS` 4000) are each larger than the whole clamp, so the
 * arithmetic that carves the deadline up hands the drain a window that has already expired.
 *
 * **And the claim marker was written first.** `claimOnce(…'flushed-<session>')` ran before the
 * drain, the outcome flush and the reflect. A hook killed at the 3 s boundary therefore left
 * the session marked flushed with none of it done — and the marker is exactly what makes a
 * later attempt stand down, so nothing ever retried. The user loses the drain *and* the
 * reflect.
 *
 * What replaces it is check-early / write-late: the marker is *read* up front so a second
 * SessionEnd stands down, and *written* after the work it claims. `claimOnce`'s own docstring
 * already argues the trade in the remaining case — "losing a session's captures is worse than
 * sending them twice", and the batch idempotency key lets the server collapse a double send.
