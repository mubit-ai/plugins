/**
 * What a Codex tool call is *recorded as*, when it failed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The defect
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Codex has no `PostToolUseFailure` event. Claude Code has one, and `capture.mjs` decides
 * `failed` from which event fired — so under Codex `failed` is `false` for every tool call
 * that has ever happened, and a failed `rm`, a failed test run and a failed `apply_patch` are
 * all stored with `outcome: 'ok'`.
 *
 * That is not a gap in memory, it is a lie in memory. `mubit_diagnose` matches an error
 * against past failures; the failure half of this plugin's memory was empty by construction on
 * this host, and the success half was polluted with things that did not work.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Where the truth actually lives — and where it does not
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Not in `tool_response`. That was the assumption going in, and a live run refutes it: for
 * `Bash`, `tool_response` is the aggregated output and nothing else. Recorded from a real
 * `codex exec`:
 *
 *     command `sh -c "echo out; exit 9"`  ->  tool_response: "out\n"
 *     command `echo hello-stdout; exit 3` ->  tool_response: "hello-stdout\n"
 *
 * Byte-for-byte what a success sends. There is no exit code in the payload at all, and the
 * `"Exit code: N\nWall time: …"` preamble is an `apply_patch` shape, not a shell one — so a
 * parser for it would fix nothing for the tool that matters most.
 *
 * The host records the outcome in the **rollout transcript**, whose path the payload carries,
 * under the same `tool_use_id`:
 *
 *     {"type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"item_completed","item":{
 *        "type":"CommandExecution","id":"exec-…","status":"failed","exit_code":9,
 *        "duration":{"secs":0,"nanos":2375}}}}
 *
 * and it is already on disk when the hook runs — confirmed by a hook that read its own
 * `transcript_path` mid-turn and found the line.
 *
 * That record also carries `duration`, which is the other thing this file covers: `duration_ms`
 * appears in no Codex hook schema, so every stored item recorded `execution_time_ms: 0` and
 * "which calls are slow" was unanswerable.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The rule this settles on
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Only a **positive** statement from the host changes the outcome. No transcript, no matching
 * record, an unreadable file, a tool with no `CommandExecution` line — all leave the item
 * exactly as it is today. The defect being fixed is a call the host said failed being stored
 * as a success; inventing an `unknown` state for every MCP tool call is a different and larger
 * change, and not one any evidence here supports.
