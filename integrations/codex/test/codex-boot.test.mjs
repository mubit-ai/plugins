/**
 * `lib/boot.mjs` — the env-before-import shim, and the only file in this plugin that is not
 * either a manifest or two lines long.
 *
 * The shared modules capture their configuration at **module scope**: `lib/config.mjs`
 * resolves `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` when `loadConfig` first runs, and
 * `lib/state.mjs` resolves the data directory the same way. So under Codex — which exports
 * none of those names (probed against a live hook process) — something has to put them there *before*
 * the shared module is imported, not after. Setting them afterwards is indistinguishable from
 * not setting them at all.
 *
 * That is the same ordering rule `mcp/src/launch.mjs` already lives by, and the same one
 * `test/launch.test.mjs` already guards on the Claude Code side. This file is its twin for
 * the hook entry points.
 *
 * Three names are synthesised, and each has a different source:
 *
 *   | name                 | from                    | why not the environment |
 *   | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
 *   | `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | this module's own URL   | Codex sets no PLUGIN_ROOT of any spelling |
 *   | `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` | `~/.claude/plugins/data/mubit-memory` | deliberately the **same** directory Claude Code uses |
 *   | `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | `process.cwd()`         | Codex runs a hook in the project directory, and says so in `payload.cwd` |
 *
 * The data directory is the one that looks like a mistake and is not. A Codex session and a
 * Claude Code session in the same directory derive the same run id (codex-runid.test.mjs) and
 * share one data directory *on purpose*: that is what lets memory flow between the two
 * harnesses. Splitting them would give a user two disjoint memories of one project.
