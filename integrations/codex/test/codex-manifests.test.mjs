/**
 * Codex manifest lint, as executable tests.
 *
 * These are data assertions over files. Nothing here starts a process or opens a socket, so
 * this is the cheapest early warning for the breakage that only shows up at install time: a
 * hook pointing at a bundle the build no longer produces, a version that drifted from the
 * Claude Code plugin, an event name Codex has never heard of.
 *
 * Four Codex facts, all recorded against a live host, decide what is asserted here:
 *
 *   1. **Eleven events, not thirteen.** No `CwdChanged`, no `PostToolUseFailure`, no
 *      `StopFailure`. Registering one is not an error Codex reports — it parses the file and
 *      the handler never fires, which reads exactly like a plugin that was never installed.
 *   2. **No `if:` predicate.** Claude Code's `PreToolUse` registrations carry
 *      `if: "Bash(rm *)"`. Codex's `HookHandlerConfig` has no such field, so a registration
 *      that keeps one is a registration that fires on **every** matching tool call.
 *   3. **Shell strings, not exec form.** A handler's `command` is one string run through
 *      `$SHELL -lc`, and no `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` reaches it. The path has to be absolute, which
 *      is why `hooks.json` here is a *template* the setup skill rewrites rather than
 *      something Codex reads in place.
 *   4. **`timeout`, in seconds, and SessionEnd is clamped to 3.** Writing 8 there is not an
 *      error either; Codex silently clamps it and says so on a stderr nobody reads.
 *
 * Every missing file fails with the path and what defines it. Nothing is skipped — a skipped
 * manifest check is indistinguishable from a passing one on a CI dashboard.
