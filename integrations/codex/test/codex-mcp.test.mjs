/**
 * The Codex plugin's MCP server, over real stdio.
 *
 * Everything else in this suite can be answered from source. This cannot: the tool table is
 * built inside the bundled server at registration time, so what is *advertised* exists
 * nowhere but the shipped `mcp/dist/`. That gap is how a server which ignored
 * `MUBIT_MCP_TOOLS` once shipped past a green suite next door.
 *
 * So this file runs `integrations/codex/mcp/dist/index.js` — the file `.mcp.json` actually
 * points Codex at — speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC to it, and asserts on the answers.
 *
 * The Codex-specific stake is the **duplicate bundle**. Two independently installable plugins
 * cannot share a path: a Codex marketplace install copies the plugin directory into
 * `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/…`, and nothing in that copy can reach `../claude-code`. So this
 * plugin carries its own copy of the 5.9 MB vendored server, and the two copies have to stay
 * the same server — a stale one here means a Codex user's `mubit_learned` writes a shape the
 * hosted instance stopped accepting, with no local symptom at all.
