 * `scripts/setup.mjs` — install Mubit's registrations into the Codex user layer.
 *
 *   node scripts/setup.mjs <plugin-root> [--with-pre-tool] [--no-trust]
 *
 * This is the mechanical half of `mubit-memory:setup`, extracted so it can be read before it
 * is run and so the skill has one thing to invoke rather than a JSON-RPC handshake to
 * hand-roll. The skill still owns the judgement: which of these steps to take, whether the
 * user wants the `PreToolUse` warnings, and — the one that matters — asking before trust.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a Codex plugin needs an install step at all
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Codex ignores a `hooks.json` bundled in a plugin, and cannot resolve a path in a plugin's
 * `.mcp.json` — no `${VAR}` layer, and a relative path resolves against the project
 * directory. Both are recorded against a live host. So the
 * plugin ships both files as templates carrying `{{PLUGIN_ROOT}}`, and this substitutes the
 * real install path and writes them where Codex actually reads.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The three things it is careful about
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. **It merges, it does not overwrite.** `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` is the user's, and other
 *    tools register there. Every handler that is not ours is preserved; ours are replaced by
 *    path, so re-running is idempotent rather than additive.
 * 2. **It trusts only its own hooks.** The `hooks/list` result is filtered to commands under
 *    this plugin root before anything is written to `config.toml`. Trusting the whole file
 *    would silently approve another tool's hook on the user's behalf.
 * 3. **It backs up both files** it touches, to `<name>.before-mubit`, before touching them.
 *
 * `--no-trust` does everything except the `config.toml` write, for anyone who would rather
 * approve the hooks themselves in the TUI's `/hooks` screen. The result is identical; the
 * difference is who decided. `--data-dir=<path>` overrides step 0's resolution.
 *
 * Node >= 20 built-ins only, and it shells out to `codex` for the two things Codex owns.

 * `config.toml` with **the named** `[hooks.state."…"]` tables removed, bodies and all.
 *
 * Line-based rather than a TOML parse, because this file is the user's: it carries their
 * project trust levels, their model choice, their notify hook. Round-tripping it through a
 * parser and a serialiser would reformat all of that to rewrite eleven tables. Removing the
 * lines leaves every byte we do not own exactly as it was.
 *
 * A `[hooks.state]` table's body is a single `trusted_hash` line, so the state machine only
 * has to survive that and the blank lines between tables; anything else ends the skip.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why it takes a set, and not simply "everything"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It used to remove every `[hooks.state.*]` table and write ours back. Every *other* tool's
 * hook trust went with them — and Codex skips an untrusted hook in silence, so the other tool
 * simply stopped working on our re-run, with nothing anywhere saying why.
 *
 * The obvious fix — keep the tables whose key is not under this plugin root — cannot be
 * written, because a trust key is `<sourcePath>:<event>:<group>:<index>` and carries no
 * command. Ours and another vendor's handler in the same `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` have the
 * same `sourcePath`, differing only in an index. The key alone cannot tell you whose it is.
 *
 * What can is `hooks/list`: the host reports every live handler with its key *and* its
 * command, so the caller resolves ours there and passes the keys down. Two kinds go:
 *
 *   1. **Ours**, which are about to be written back with a current hash.
 *   2. **Keys naming the file we rewrite that the host no longer lists at all** — provably
 *      dead, since a key is a position and the host just enumerated every position in that
 *      file. Without this, a reinstall at a new path leaves its old tables behind forever.
 *
 * Everything else is preserved byte-for-byte, including a live foreign handler's trust and
 * any key belonging to another file entirely.
 *
 * @param {string} text
 * @param {(key: string) => boolean} shouldRemove

// bridges exactly three `MUBIT_CC_*` names onto the host names `lib/` reads.

//
//   `MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR` — the MCP server derives the run id itself, with the same strategy

//   /mubit-memory:remember into a run pre-prompt recall never reads.

//   mark an item as being about the plugin itself, and the install root is one of them.
//   Unset, the server cannot recognise its own install path; under Codex that path lives
//   inside `$CODEX_HOME`, so it carries the user's home directory into anything the
//   suppression fails to catch.
//
//   `MUBIT_CC_PROJECT_DIR` — NOT passed, on purpose. `codex mcp add` writes to
//   `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`: one registration serves every project on the machine, so a
//   project directory pinned at setup time would be wrong everywhere except the directory it
//   was taken in. Falling back to the launch cwd is the correct answer, and the run id is
