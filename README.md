<h1 align="center">Mubit Memory</h1>

<p align="center">
  Persistent memory for <strong>Claude Code</strong> and the <strong>Codex CLI</strong> — it records your
  work as you do it, puts the lessons that matter in front of the model before every prompt,
  and learns which ones actually helped.

An agent that forgets everything at `/clear` makes you the memory. You re-explain the same
constraint, and it repeats the same mistake in a new file. Mubit Memory closes that loop
without you managing it: nothing to write down, no notes file to curate, no tool the model has
to remember to call.

```text
● mubit: cc-acme-api-… · hosted · recall 4/380 tok · lessons 5g

> the auth integration tests are failing again

  <mubit-memory run="cc-acme-api-…" sources="2" tokens="180">

  ### Active Rules
  - [block] Integration tests run against a real Postgres, never a mock.
    (why: a mocked suite went green while the production migration was broken)

  ### Lessons Learned
  - `make test-auth` needs SEED=1, or the fixture user is missing and every
    assertion fails on a null session.
```

You typed one line. The rule and the lesson were retrieved and injected before the model read
it — no tool call, no extra model call, and 180 tokens of context.

## Why Mubit Memory

- **You never invoke it.** Memory arrives before your prompt does. There is no "search your
  memory first" instruction to write, and no tool the model can forget to call.
- **It captures involuntarily.** Every tool call, failure and turn is recorded as it happens,
  including other MCP servers' output. Failures are the ones that produce the best lessons.
- **It gets better with use.** Each turn is scored against the memories that were injected for
  it, so what helped ranks higher next time and what did not stops appearing.
- **One memory across two CLIs.** A Codex session and a Claude Code session in the same
  directory are one run sharing one memory. That is the design, not a side effect.
- **Secrets never leave the machine.** A three-stage scrub runs before anything reaches even
  the local spool, and a `.env` is dropped whole rather than redacted.
- **It cannot break your session.** Every hook exits 0 on every path. A dead endpoint costs
  you a memory, never a turn.
- **Your endpoint, your data.** Point it at the instance you were issued. There is no
  telemetry channel and no second destination.

## Quick start

You need two values, both from the [Mubit console](https://console.mubit.ai): an **endpoint**
like `https://api.mubit.ai`, and an **API key** that starts with `mbt_`.

Requirements: **Node 20 or newer**. There is no build step and no `npm install` — the bundles
ship committed.

### Claude Code

```text
/plugin marketplace add mubit-ai/plugins
/plugin install mubit-memory@mubit
/reload-plugins
```

Then set your credentials in `/plugin` → **Mubit Memory** → **configure**, and **start a new
session**. `/reload-plugins` registers the hooks but does not fire `SessionStart`, so until a
new session begins the plugin has never actually run. It looks broken; it is fine.

You are done when a new session opens with `Mubit memory is active` and a run id.

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex CLI</strong> — three commands and a setup step that is not optional</summary>

Requires **Codex CLI 0.146.0 or newer**, which is where Git marketplace sources landed.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add mubit-ai/plugins
codex plugin add mubit-memory@mubit

# Register the hooks and the MCP server into your Codex config, then sign in.
PLUGIN=$(ls -d ~/.codex/plugins/cache/mubit/mubit-memory/*/ | tail -1)
node "$PLUGIN/scripts/setup.mjs" "$PLUGIN"
node "$PLUGIN/scripts/login.mjs"
```

`Connected to https://api.mubit.ai.` means the key is valid and stored. Then start a new Codex
session — hooks and MCP servers are read at session start.

**Do not skip `setup.mjs`.** Codex copies a plugin's bundled `hooks.json` and never reads it,
and a plugin-declared MCP server cannot resolve its own entry point there. So both ship as
templates, and `setup` installs them into your Codex config with real paths substituted.
Without it you get a plugin that installs perfectly and captures nothing. It is idempotent,
backs up what it touches, and **must be re-run after every upgrade** — editing a hook
registration changes its content hash, which returns it to untrusted, and an untrusted hook is
skipped silently under `codex exec`.

Full walkthrough, including the sandbox and trust gotchas:
[`integrations/codex/README.md`](integrations/codex/README.md).

</details>

Confirm either install with `/mubit-memory:setup` (Codex: `mubit-memory:setup`). A `ready`
state plus your endpoint and a run id means you are finished.

## What it does

Three things happen on their own. None of them spends a model call of yours.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P["Your prompt"] --> R["Recall<br/>inject what is relevant"]
  R --> M["The model"]
  M --> T["Tool calls and replies"]
  T --> S["Redact, then spool<br/>no network per call"]
  S -. "background" .-> E[("Your Mubit<br/>endpoint")]
  E -.-> R
  M --> X["Session ends"] --> F["Reflect<br/>extract lessons that outlive the run"]
  F -.-> E
```

- **Capture** — every tool call, failure and turn is redacted and written to a local spool, then
  sent in the background. A tool call makes no network request of its own.
- **Recall** — relevant memory is injected before each prompt, inside a 1500-token budget you
  control. A memory this conversation has already seen is repeated as a one-line pointer
  instead of in full.
- **Reflect** — at session end, lessons are extracted from what the run actually did. This is
  the path that lets a lesson outlive the run that learned it.

Runs are **per-directory** by default: one project is one memory, which is also what makes
Claude Code and Codex in that directory share one. Change it with `runStrategy`
(`git-branch`, `per-conversation`, `static`).

## Commands

Fifteen skills, identical on both hosts. `/mubit-memory:<name>` in Claude Code,
`mubit-memory:<name>` in Codex.

| Command | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `remember` | Save a durable lesson, rule, or standing preference. |
| `recall` | Search memory for detail beyond what was injected this turn. |
| `pin` | Pin a constraint for the rest of this run — "don't touch the vendored server". |
| `forget` | Delete a lesson, or down-weight one that is merely wrong. |
| `dashboard` | A local page over the record: every turn, what memory was injected into it, what that earned, and each lesson's history. Loopback only, bearer-token gated. |
| `doctor` | Diagnose connectivity and memory health, cheapest check first. |
| `setup` | Confirm the endpoint and key are set and the instance answers. |
| `import` | Backfill memory from transcripts already on this machine, so an install made after the work still knows about it. Sends nothing without `--send`. |
| `activity` | Audit what is stored, and export the record as JSONL. |

Also: `auth`, `reflect`, `strategies`, `checkpoint`, `memory-health` and `handoff`. Claude Code
additionally ships `@mubit-memory:mubit-recall`, a subagent that searches memory in an isolated
context and returns a synthesis rather than raw evidence.

### The tools the model uses on its own

You do not call these. Seven are registered by default, the same on both hosts:

```text
mubit_recall          search memory by topic
mubit_learned         save one durable lesson
mubit_outcome         credit the memories that helped
mubit_diagnose        match a failure against past ones
mubit_dereference     expand a reference id it already holds
mubit_status          is memory reachable
mubit_memory_health   what is actually stored
```

The bundled server carries 21. The other fourteen cost nothing until you name them in
`mcpTools` — a list you supply is used verbatim, not merged with the default.

## What leaves your machine

Captured tool calls, their output, your prompts and the model's replies go to **your** Mubit
endpoint and nowhere else. Before any of it reaches even the local spool it passes three
stages, in this order.

1. **Pattern scrub.** Matches become `[REDACTED:<kind>]`, naming the rule that fired —
   `assignment`, `pem`, `jwt`, `bearer`, `github-token`, `aws-access-key`, `openai-key`,
   `stripe-key`, `url-credentials`, and a `high-entropy` catch-all. Hex-only strings cannot
   trip it, so git SHAs survive.
2. **Path denylist.** A capture whose subject matches is **dropped entirely, not scrubbed** — a
   redacted `.env` is still a map of which secrets a project holds. The floor covers `.env*`,
   `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.kdbx`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `secrets/**`, `.ssh/**`,
   `.aws/**`, `.gnupg/**`, `**/credentials`, `**/.netrc` — **plus everything git ignores**. Your
   own globs append to that floor; they never replace it.
3. **Byte caps.** 4 KiB per tool-input field, 8 KiB per tool output. The scrub runs *first*, so
   truncation can never slice a secret in half and leave a usable prefix.

Turning redaction off disables stage 1 only. Stages 2 and 3 always run. The plugin suppresses
its own traffic, the local log is scrubbed with the same rules so it is safe to attach to an
issue, and the status line performs no network I/O at all. There is no telemetry channel: the
endpoint you configure is the only destination.

Full detail, including what local state is kept and for how long:
[what leaves your machine](integrations/claude-code/README.md#what-leaves-your-machine-and-what-does-not).

## Configuration

Every option has a plugin setting and a `MUBIT_*` environment variable. Precedence, highest
first: plugin settings → environment → stored credentials → a per-project `.mubit-cc.json` →
the default. The ones worth knowing about:

| Option | Default | What it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recallTokenBudget` | `1500` | The ceiling on tokens injected per prompt. The largest recurring cost — lower it when context is tight. |
| `runStrategy` | `per-directory` | How a session maps to a run. `static` plus a pinned id is how a team shares one memory across machines. |
| `recallAsync` | `false` | Never make a prompt wait on recall, at the cost of one turn of staleness. |
| `preToolWarnings` | `false` | Show the model a stored rule just before an `rm` or `git push`. It only ever warns. |
| `capture` / `recall` | `true` | Turn either half off. |

The [Claude Code guide](integrations/claude-code/README.md#configuration) documents all 25.

## When something looks wrong

Run `doctor` first — it diagnoses connectivity, memory health and stuck ingest, cheapest check
first. The states `setup` and the status line report:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `auth_failed` | Key missing, wrong, or revoked. Not a network problem. |
| `unreachable` | Wrong endpoint, or the instance is not running. Under Codex, usually the sandbox. |
| `warming` | The instance is still starting. Wait and retry — not a failure. |
| `not_responding` | Timeouts, usually load. Retry before concluding anything. |

Two that catch nearly everyone: under Codex, a command you have not approved runs with no
network, so a perfectly healthy endpoint reports `ENOTFOUND` — approve it and run it again. And
after any upgrade, re-run `setup.mjs`, or the hooks are silently untrusted.

## Verifying what you are about to run

Everything here executes on your machine: the hooks run as Node processes on session events,
and the MCP server as a long-lived subprocess. Two things make that auditable.

- `integrations/claude-code/hooks/src/` and `lib/` are the readable source for every bundle in
  `hooks/dist/` and `bin/`. Rebuild rather than trusting them: the build regenerates the
  bundles in place, so a clean `git diff` afterwards is proof the committed artifacts match
  their source.
- `integrations/claude-code/test/` carries the full suite, redaction cases included. Run it,
  then run it again against the code that actually ships.

```bash
claude plugin validate .                    # the manifests, from this directory

cd integrations/claude-code
npm test                                    # the suite
MUBIT_CC_TEST_TARGET=dist npm test          # the same, against the committed bundles

# Rebuild the bundles in place. A clean diff afterwards is proof they match their source.
MUBIT_CC_BUILD_SKIP_SERVER=1 npm run build
git diff --exit-code -- hooks/dist mcp/dist/index.js bin
```

Both hosts execute these directories as fetched, with no build step, which is why
`hooks/dist/`, `mcp/dist/` and `bin/` are committed artifacts rather than build output.
