# Mubit memory, end to end

A hands-on walkthrough of one thread through the `mubit-memory` plugin: a session opens, a
prompt arrives, memory is recalled, tools run, the turn ends, work is sent, the session ends
and a lesson is extracted. You drive every step by hand and watch both sides of the wire.

Nothing here talks to a real Mubit instance. `labs/fake-mubit.mjs` stands up all eleven routes
the plugin knows how to call and prints every request, so "what actually leaves the machine"
is something you read, not something you take on faith.

> The labs need no `npm install` — every hook, every lib module and both MCP entry points
> import only Node built-ins, and the bundles are committed. Run everything from the repo
> root; the labs keep all of their state in `labs/.work/`, and `node labs/setup.mjs --reset`
> removes it.

## The model in 60 seconds

Two surfaces, one memory.

```

Five facts that explain most of the design:

1. **A hook is a process.** Claude Code spawns `node hooks/dist/<name>.mjs`, writes a JSON
   payload to its stdin, reads JSON from its stdout, and enforces a timeout. That is the whole
   API. You can run any hook by hand — which is what these labs do.
2. **Every hook exits 0, always.** A dead server, an unwritable data dir, a corrupt state file
   — each costs a memory, never a turn. (`hooks/src/*.mjs`, and `lib/hook.mjs` which wraps
   them all.)
3. **The hot path never touches the network.** Capture writes one file per item into a spool.
   A separate, detached `drain.mjs` batches the spool and posts it. That split is why capture
   can run on every tool call.
4. **Local state is the whole database, and it is all JSON.** `peek` prints it.
5. **The run id is the join key.** Hook captures and MCP-tool writes must derive the *same*
   run id or one query can never see both. Lab 1 and Lab 7 are the two halves of this.

The thread you will follow:

```

```

## Setup

Two terminals, both at the repo root.

**Terminal A — the instance:**

```bash
node labs/setup.mjs        # creates labs/.work/{data,demo-app}; --reset starts over
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs   # leave this running; it prints every request
```

**Terminal B — the hooks:**

```bash
source labs/env.sh
```

That exports exactly what Claude Code exports for a real install (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`,
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`) plus the plugin's own settings, and defines four
helpers:

| Helper | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `hook <name> <payload.json> [args]` | runs `hooks/src/<name>.mjs` the way Claude Code does |
| `mcp <tool> ['<args>'] [--routes]` | calls one MCP tool; `--routes` shows where it went |
| `peek [section]` | prints the plugin's local state — `peek --help` lists sections |
| `runid ['<payload json>']` | derives the run id without running a hook |

It also exports `LAB_RUN_ID`, the run id these settings derive — a hash of the project path,
so it differs per worktree. The fake instance uses it to mark which of its sample lessons are
*yours*, so start it from a shell that has sourced `env.sh`.

Nothing touches your real `~/.claude` data. To wipe and start again:
`node labs/setup.mjs --reset && node labs/setup.mjs`.

---

## Lab 1 — Identity: which run does this session write to?

Everything else is keyed on the answer, so it comes first.

```bash
runid
```

```
strategy    per-directory
projectDir  …/labs/.work/demo-app
run_id      cc-demo-app-<hash8>
agent_id    claude-code-2f183a4e
```

`cc-<slug>-<hash8>` — the slug is the directory name, the hash covers the **git toplevel**. Two
terminals in one repo share a run; two repos that happen to share a directory name do not. The
hash is left out above because yours is your own: it is a function of the absolute path, so
this checkout and a copy of it elsewhere are different runs.

Now try the other three strategies:

```bash
MUBIT_CC_RUN_STRATEGY=git-branch       runid '{"session_id":"s2"}'
MUBIT_CC_RUN_STRATEGY=per-conversation runid '{"session_id":"1a2b3c4d-5e6f-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d"}'
MUBIT_CC_RUN_STRATEGY=static           runid '{"session_id":"s3"}'
```

```
cc-demo-app-main-<hash8>                       ← branch is in the name AND the hash
cc-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d        ← one conversation, one run
REFUSED: MUBIT_CC_RUN_STRATEGY=static requires MUBIT_CC_RUN_ID…
```

That refusal is the point of the module. A run id the plugin did not derive is not one it will
use: `lib/runid.mjs` throws rather than emit a fallback, and `lib/http.mjs` refuses to put one
on the wire even if something else produced it. Two layers for one rule, because the identity
is the join key for everything stored — Lab 7 is where the second layer earns its keep.

`/clear` is the other interesting source — it must start a *new* run:

```bash
runid '{"session_id":"clear-demo","source":"clear"}'   # → …-c1
runid '{"session_id":"clear-demo","source":"clear"}'   # → …-c2
peek sessions
```

The counter lives in `sessions/<host_session_id>.json`, which is why `deriveRunId` is
deliberately not a pure function.

**Read:** `lib/runid.mjs` — the source table is in the doc comment at the top.

**Break it:** `MUBIT_CC_RUN_ID=default MUBIT_CC_RUN_STRATEGY=static runid`. Why is a refusal
better than a fallback here?

---

## Lab 2 — SessionStart: the session opens

```bash
hook session-start 01-session-start.json
```

Terminal A shows three calls in order: `GET /v2/core/health`, then
`POST /v2/control/agents/register`, then `POST /v2/control/activity` — the standing-lessons
read goes to the activity feed, not the route named after lessons (Lab 11a). A fourth call, `POST
/v2/control/context`, lands a beat later from a **detached child** — session start prefetches
the resume block Lab 3 will inject, so the first prompt does not pay for its assembly.
Terminal B prints what the model will see:

```json
{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"SessionStart","additionalContext":"# Mubit memory is active\n\nRun: cc-demo-app-<hash8> (hosted)\nRelevant memory is injected automatically before each of your turns — do not search for it preemptively.\n…"},
 "systemMessage":"mubit: hosted · run cc-demo-app-<hash8> · 2 global lessons"}
```

Three things worth stopping on:

- **`additionalContext` is the injection channel.** Whatever a hook puts there is prepended to
  the model's context. This is the entire mechanism behind "memory is active".
- **"do not search for it preemptively"** is load-bearing. Without that sentence the model
  helpfully calls the recall tool on turn one of every session and pays for it every time.
- **Sub-budgets.** 2500 ms total, split 400/600/900 across health/register/lessons. A slow
  lesson list costs the lesson list, not the steer block — the one thing this hook may never do
  is fail to speak.

```bash
peek marker
```

`status/<run_id>.json` is the only file the status line reads. Render it:

```bash
echo '{"session_id":"1a2b3c4d-5e6f-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d"}' | node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/statusline.mjs"
# ● mubit: cc-demo-app-<hash8> · hosted · recall 3/60 tok · lessons 2g
```

**Read:** `hooks/src/session-start.mjs`.

---

## Lab 3 — UserPromptSubmit: recall, and the ladder

One event, **two** registered hooks. They run as separate processes with no ordering
guarantee, and they write to the same file — how they avoid clobbering each other is the lesson.

```bash
hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json
hook stage-prompt  02-prompt.json
```

`prompt-recall` returns the block that gets injected in front of the prompt — and on the
**first** prompt of a session, two blocks: the `<mubit-resume>` briefing that session start
prefetched (where earlier work on this project left off), then the recall proper:

```
<mubit-resume run="cc-demo-app-<hash8>" sources="1" tokens="21">
Assembled from memory at the start of this session …
## Active rules
- Poll the ingest job; "queued" is not "stored".
</mubit-resume>
<mubit-memory run="cc-demo-app-<hash8>" sources="3" tokens="60">
Recalled from memory of earlier work — it may be incomplete or out of date, …
## Active rules
- Ingest returns when queued, not when stored; poll the job id.
## Lessons
- A job stays queued until indexing completes — waiting is the fix, not retrying.
## Facts
- IngestAccepted.status is always "queued" on success.
</mubit-memory>
```

In Terminal A, look at the request that produced it:

```
POST /v2/control/query   mode=direct_bypass  lane=semantic_search  evidence_only=true
```

**The ladder is the most important design decision in the plugin.** The obvious implementation
— ask the server for a ready-made context block — is the slow path, and it would sit in front of
every keystroke, forever. So:

| Rung | Request | Entered when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `query{mode:"direct_bypass", evidence_only:true}` | always — the primary path |
| 2 | `query{mode:"agent_routed"}` | rung 1 returned **403** (policy, not fault) **and** you opted in with `MUBIT_CC_RECALL_FALLBACK=agent_routed` — by default a denial goes dark instead, because rung 2 takes seconds on every prompt |
| 3 | `context{mode:"sections"}` | only if you opt in with `recallAssemble: server` |

Rung 1 returns raw `evidence[]`; `lib/assemble.mjs` renders it into sections locally. That is
why the block above has `## Active rules` before `## Lessons` even though the lesson could score
higher — section order outranks score, so a locally assembled block reads the same as one
assembled by the server.

Now the state both hooks touched:

```bash
peek turns
```

```
prompt          the ingest job stays queued after the batch was accepted — is that a bug in enqueue()?
recalled        [ref_rule_1, ref_lesson_1, ref_fact_1]   ← becomes RecordOutcome.entry_ids
```

`stage-prompt` wrote `prompt` (the `Stop` payload carries the *answer* but not the question —
without this file every captured turn would be half a conversation). `prompt-recall` wrote
`recalled`. Both do read-modify-write and rename into place, and each preserves the other's
key. Order does not matter; that is the design.

**Questions:**
- Why does `prompt-recall` emit `{"suppressOutput":true}` and inject *nothing* when recall
  comes back empty? (Hint: what does "I found nothing" teach the model about this channel?)
- Why is a prompt shorter than 8 characters skipped entirely? Why are `/slash` commands?

**Break it:** `MUBIT_CC_RECALL=0 hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json` — dials nothing.

Then squeeze the budget and watch the trim:

```bash
MUBIT_CC_RECALL_TOKENS=40 hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json
peek marker
# recall  sources=2 tokens=37 dropped=1 …
```

Three memories became two — and note *which* two. The long `## Lessons` line did not fit, but
the shorter `## Facts` line after it still did. An item that does not fit is skipped and
counted, never treated as a stop signal.

**Read:** `hooks/src/prompt-recall.mjs` (the ladder), `lib/assemble.mjs` (the rendering).

---

## Lab 4 — PostToolUse: capture, redaction, and the two drops

Four tool calls. Two are captured, two are dropped, and the drops are the interesting half.

```bash
hook capture 03-edit.json            # Edit src/queue.js
hook capture 04-read-env.json        # Read .env
hook capture 05-read-ignored.json    # Read build/bundle.js
hook capture 06-bash-failure.json --failure
peek spool
```

Terminal A stays silent through all four: **capture never touches the network.** It writes one
file per item into `runs/<run_id>/spool/` and stops.

```
cc-demo-app-<hash8>   2 item(s) pending
  item_id   cc-toolu_lab_0001
  intent    trace   importance medium
  env_tags  tool:claude-code repo:demo-app branch:main
  text      Edit(file_path=src/queue.js, old_string=…) -> Applied 1 edit to src/queue.js

  item_id   cc-toolu_lab_0004
  intent    trace   importance high
  text      Bash(…) FAILED: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000 export [REDACTED:assignment]
            Authorization: Bearer [REDACTED:github-token] aws key [REDACTED:aws-access-key]
            built from 9f2a11c4e5d6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0
```

Six things happened there:

1. **`.env` was dropped, not scrubbed.** A redacted `.env` is still a map of which secrets the
   project holds. Denylisted subjects never reach the spool at all.
2. **`build/bundle.js` was dropped too** — it is git-ignored, and the denylist honours
   `.gitignore` for free. You already declared those paths not-for-sharing.
3. **Three secret shapes were replaced**, each naming the rule that fired.
4. **The 40-hex git SHA survived.** Entropy over a 16-symbol alphabet is bounded by exactly
   4.0 and the threshold is `>= 4.0`, so a SHA can never trip the generic entropy rule. That is
   a property of the threshold, not a lucky fixture.
5. **The failure is graded `high`** while the successful edit is `medium`. A failed approach is
   the highest-value thing a coding agent can remember — it is the one class of knowledge the
   model cannot re-derive by reading the code.
6. **Every item carries an `intent`**, set locally from the tool and its outcome.

**Break it:** try to capture the plugin talking to itself —

```bash
echo '{"hook_event_name":"PostToolUse","session_id":"x","tool_name":"Bash","tool_use_id":"t9","tool_input":{"command":"curl $MUBIT_ENDPOINT/v2/core/health"},"tool_output":"OK"}' \
  | node "$HOOKS/capture.mjs"
peek spool     # unchanged
```

Self-reference suppression. Without it the plugin records its own traffic, recalls it, then
records the recall.

**Read:** `hooks/src/capture.mjs`, `lib/redact.mjs`, `lib/classify.mjs`, `lib/spool.mjs`.

---

## Lab 5 — Stop: the turn closes, the drain flies, the outcome lands

```bash
hook capture 07-stop.json --stop
sleep 1
peek spool turns jobs
```

Terminal A now shows the two calls that matter most:

```
POST /v2/control/ingest
    idempotency_key=cc-p_lab_0001-0-06b7b1a469a8
    items=3
      · cc-toolu_lab_0001    trace        medium  "Edit(file_path=src/queue.js, …"
      · cc-toolu_lab_0004    trace        high    "Bash(…) FAILED: …"
      · cc-stop-p_lab_0001   task_result  medium  "Q: the ingest job stays queued … A: Not a bug in enqueue()…"
    replied job_id=job_lab_1 status=queued deduplicated=false

POST /v2/control/outcome
    outcome=success  signal=0.2  reference_id=global
    entry_ids=[les_g2, les_g1, ref_rule_1, ref_lesson_1, ref_fact_1]
    idempotency_key=cc-outcome-cc-demo-app-<hash8>-p_lab_0001
```

Five ids, not three: the turn reinforces the **injected standing lessons** (`les_g2`,
`les_g1` — the two session start put in front of the model) as well as what rung 1
recalled for this prompt. A lesson the model worked under is a lesson the outcome should
move, whether or not this particular prompt re-recalled it.

Walk the chain backwards and the whole point of the plugin appears: those `entry_ids`
are the reference ids of the memories **injected at session start and returned by rung 1
in Lab 3**, which `prompt-recall`
staged into the turn file, which the drain read when the turn ended. Recall feeds attribution;
attribution improves the next recall. That loop is the product.

Details worth noticing:

- **The third item is the turn itself** — `Q: … / A: …`, assembled from the staged prompt plus
  `last_assistant_message`. Neither half exists in one payload.
- **`signal: 0.2`, not 1.0.** A turn completing is weak positive evidence that the recalled
  memory helped, not proof. A failed turn is `-0.3`.
- **`status: "queued"` means accepted, not stored.** The spool files are unlinked anyway — the
  alternative is holding every item until a poll no hot path can afford. `jobs.json` keeps the
  last 20 job ids so the doctor skill can go back and ask.
- **Two idempotency keys, both derived, neither random.** Batch keys cover
  `(run, prompt, sequence, item ids)`; the outcome key covers `(run, prompt)`. A retry after a
  transport timeout is a server-side no-op — which is what makes it safe to abandon a detached
  drain and safe to have two drainers race.

Run the drain by hand to see the lock work:

```bash
node "$HOOKS/drain.mjs" < labs/payloads/02-prompt.json     # nothing left to send
```

**Read:** `hooks/src/capture.mjs` (`--stop` mode), `hooks/src/drain.mjs`, `lib/spool.mjs`
(the `link(2)` lock — the comment there explains a real race that was measured, not imagined).

---

## Lab 6 — SessionEnd: reflect, and what reaches the next session

```bash
hook session-end 08-session-end.json
peek marker
```

```
POST /v2/control/reflect     run=… last_n_items=200 include_step_outcomes=true
    replied lessons_stored=1
POST /v2/control/agents/heartbeat   status=idle
```

Order is the design: **drain inline → flush pending outcomes → reflect → heartbeat idle.**

- The drain commits *before* reflect is attempted, because a failing reflect may never cost
  captures that were already accepted.
- Outcomes go out *before* reflect, so reflect can include them.
- The flush runs in a **detached child** — the hook process answers the host immediately and
  the child finishes the sends on its own clock, so a host that tears the session down the
  moment the hook returns cannot kill the flush mid-send. (Earlier builds ran it inline for
  the opposite fear — that a detached child would be reaped — and lost reflects to impatient
  teardowns; `test/session-end-detach.test.mjs` in the main suite pins the current answer.)

Why reflect matters: lessons learned in a run reach later sessions only after
`POST /v2/control/reflect` at session end. `reflectOnEnd: false` is not a latency knob — it is
opting out of cross-session memory.

**Break it:** run it a second time.

```bash
hook session-end 08-session-end.json    # stands down; no reflect
```

`claimOnce` wrote `flushed-<session_id>.marker`. SessionEnd can fire more than once (an `exit`
after a `clear`, a wrapper re-running the hook) and a double flush is a double reflect. Note it
returns *true* when it cannot write the marker: losing a session's captures is worse than
sending them twice, and the idempotency key already absorbs the double send.

**Read:** `hooks/src/session-end.mjs`.

---

## Lab 7 — The MCP server: what the model can call on purpose

The hooks are involuntary. The MCP server is the surface the model reaches for deliberately —
`/mubit-memory:recall`, `/mubit-memory:remember`, and the `mubit_*` tools behind them.

```bash
cd integrations/claude-code
node scripts/mcp-probe.mjs --call mubit_status --args '{}'
cd -
```

The probe speaks real stdio MCP: spawn, `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`,
`tools/list`, `tools/call` — exactly what Claude Code does.

```
server    mubit-memory <version>
tools     <n>
  · mubit_recall
  · mubit_learned
  …
mubit_status →
{ "status": "connected", "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8787",
  "default_session": "cc-demo-app-<hash8>" }
```

**`default_session` is the same run id Lab 1 derived.** That is the whole job of
`mcp/src/launch.mjs`. The upstream server reads its environment once, when it is imported.
So the launcher resolves config, derives the run id with the **same** `lib/runid.mjs` the hooks
use, writes five env vars, and *only then* does `await import('./server.js')`. Setting any of
them one line later is indistinguishable from not setting them at all. Ordering is a
correctness property here, not a style preference.

If the two derivations ever diverged, `/mubit-memory:remember` would write into a run that
pre-prompt recall never reads — which is exactly what happens under
`runStrategy: per-conversation`, because an MCP server starts once per session and is never
handed a `session_id`. It falls back to `per-directory` and says so on stderr.

Note the tool count: it is whatever the server actually serves for this configuration.
Probing is the only way to see that from outside, rather than trusting a README's list.

**Read:** `mcp/src/launch.mjs`, `.mcp.json`, `scripts/mcp-probe.mjs`.

---

## Lab 8 — Failure drills

Restart the fake instance with a scenario each time (Ctrl-C in Terminal A first).

### 8a — The operator disabled `direct_bypass`

```bash
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs --scenario deny-direct     # terminal A
hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json                   # terminal B
hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json
peek policy
```

First prompt: `403` on `direct_bypass` — and **nothing else**. `{"suppressOutput":true}`,
no injection, and the verdict cached to `policy/<endpoint_hash>.json` with a 24 h TTL; the
second prompt does not even probe. The descent the ladder table shows is **opt-in**: rung 2
takes seconds on every prompt, so the plugin will not walk down to it on its own. Watch it
with the fallback enabled:

```bash
rm -f labs/.work/data/policy/*.json
MUBIT_CC_RECALL_FALLBACK=agent_routed hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json
MUBIT_CC_RECALL_FALLBACK=agent_routed hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json
```

Now the first prompt descends — `403` then `agent_routed`, one rung down, never two — and the
second goes **straight to `agent_routed`**: the cached 403 costs one wasted round trip per
day instead of one per prompt.

A 403 must also not touch the circuit breaker or the `auth_failed` state — an operator turning
a lane off is not a broken instance. A **401** on the same call is the opposite: give up, never
cache it, because a cached 401 would hide a revoked key for a day.

The cache outlives this drill by 24 hours, so before going back to the earlier labs:

```bash
rm -f labs/.work/data/policy/*.json     # rung 1 is probed again on the next prompt
```

### 8b — The server refuses the payload

```bash
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs --scenario reject-ingest
hook capture 03-edit.json
node "$HOOKS/drain.mjs" < labs/payloads/02-prompt.json
peek spool rejected
```

422 → the batch moves to `spool/rejected/`, quarantined and never retried. The three-way split
is the entire design of the drain:

| Response | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2xx | accepted | unlink the spool files |
| 5xx, network, timeout | the server's problem, batch still good | leave every file, stop, retry next time |
| other 4xx (422, 400, 413…) | *this payload* is bad | quarantine — retrying forever is how a spool becomes unbounded |

401/403/404/408/429 stay retryable on purpose: nobody's memory gets deleted because they had
not pasted an API key yet.

Try `--scenario fail-ingest` (503) and watch the same batch stay put instead.

### 8c — Nothing is listening

```bash
# Ctrl-C the server, then:
rm -f labs/.work/data/status/health.json     # the 30 s readiness cache
hook session-start 01-session-start.json
hook capture 03-edit.json
peek marker breaker health
```

The steer block flips to **"Mubit memory is offline"** — the model is told, in the same channel
it would have received memory in, that there is none this session, *and* that its work is still
being kept. Capture keeps spooling; the next successful drain sends it.

The marker says `warming`, not `unreachable`, because the cold-start grace window (20 s) is
still open — an instance that is still starting is not broken, merely slow. `auth_failed` is
never masked this way, because a server still warming up does not answer 401.

Keep firing hooks with the server down and watch `breaker/<hash>.json` accumulate failures.
Five within 300 s opens the circuit for a 120 s cooldown; exactly one half-open probe dials when
it ends. The status line then reads `· paused 94s`, which tells you "it recovers in 94 seconds"
rather than "this thing is dead".

### 8d — Everything is slow

```bash
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs --scenario slow      # 2.5 s on every route
rm -f labs/.work/data/status/health.json      # bypass the 30 s readiness cache
time hook prompt-recall 02-prompt.json
time hook session-start 01-session-start.json
```

`prompt-recall` returns `{"suppressOutput":true}` at ~1.5 s — its internal budget, well inside
the 3 s hook timeout — and injects nothing rather than making the user wait. `session-start`
returns in **under half a second**: health is the gate and gets only 400 ms of the 2500 ms
budget, so a server that will not answer produces the offline steer block (state
`not_responding`, not `unreachable` — three consecutive timeouts is a different fact from a
refused connection) instead of spending the whole budget finding out.

**Read:** `lib/breaker.mjs`, `lib/http.mjs` (the five pre-flight guards at the top are worth
the read on their own).

## Lab 9 — Bonus: PreCompact, the one blocking network call

```bash
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs                    # healthy again
hook checkpoint 10-precompact.json --pre    # run from the repo root: the transcript path is relative
peek spool
node "$HOOKS/checkpoint.mjs" --post < labs/payloads/10-precompact.json
```

Every other hook would rather lose a memory than cost you a millisecond, because what it wanted
to capture is still on disk afterwards. `PreCompact` is the one event where that is false: once
the host compacts, the transcript is gone. So this hook blocks — and it spools its summary item
*before* it posts, so the anchor survives even a call that hangs.

The transcript is also the densest secret surface the plugin ever touches. Check the spooled
item: the `DATABASE_PASSWORD=` line in `labs/payloads/transcript.jsonl` never reaches the wire.

---

## Lab 10 — The tests are the real spec

```bash
cd integrations/claude-code && npm test        # ~32 s, ~1560 assertions, no network, no Docker
```

`test/helpers/harness.mjs` is worth reading before any of the test files: `fakeMubit()` is a
richer version of `labs/fake-mubit.mjs` (per-route replies, delays, hangs, request assertions),
and `runHook()` spawns hooks exactly as Claude Code does. Every design decision described above
has a test that pins it — `prompt-recall`'s test asserts rung 3 is *never* reached by default,
because it is the first thing a well-meaning maintainer would "simplify" into place, and it is
the slowest path.

Pick one behaviour you found surprising in Labs 1–9 and find the test that pins it. Then change
the implementation to break it and watch which test fails. (One timing-sensitive test can flake
under load; re-run before believing a single failure.)

## Lab 11 — Watching the wire: what an MCP tool actually dials

Lab 7 asked the server what it exposes. This one asks a harder question: when the model calls
a tool, **where does the request go?** A tool's answer tells you what came back. It does not
tell you which route produced it — and for several of the plugin's guarantees, the route is
the guarantee.

```bash
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs        # terminal A
source labs/env.sh              # terminal B, from the repo root
mcp mubit_lessons '{}' --routes
```

`mcp` is `labs/mcp-drive.mjs`. It differs from `scripts/mcp-probe.mjs` in exactly two ways,
both of which matter here.

**It never needs the key.** The probe reads `MUBIT_ENDPOINT` / `MUBIT_API_KEY` from the
environment, so pointing it at a real instance means exporting a real credential into a shell.
This driver sets `MUBIT_CC_DATA_DIR` and stops, and lets the launcher's own `loadConfig()`
resolve the stored credential the way it does in a real session. Nothing reads the key,
nothing prints it. That is what makes 11e safe.

**It shows the routes.** `--routes` diffs `labs/.work/requests.ndjson` across the call.

### 11a — The catalogue does not read the lessons route

```
routes dialled by that call:
  POST /v2/control/activity → 200
```

Not `/v2/control/lessons` — the route whose name matches the tool. The catalogue reads the
activity feed. Both routes answer `200`, so only the wire tells you which one a tool was on.

### 11b — A catalogue that says what it showed

```bash
mcp mubit_lessons '{"scope":"global"}' --routes
```

Note what rides beside the rows: a `mubit_lessons_guard` object saying what was shown and what
matched. A catalogue that cannot say what it left out is not one you can act on.

### 11c — A partial answer that says so

```bash
pkill -f labs/fake-mubit.mjs
node labs/fake-mubit.mjs --scenario truncate    # pages at 2, corpus padded past a census
mcp mubit_lessons '{}'
```

```json
"mubit_lessons_guard": {
  "shown": 0,
  "partial": true,
  "note": "This catalogue is partial: the listing was cut short (max_pages) … No total is available."
}
```

**There is no `matched` key.** That absence is deliberate. A count printed next to an
admission of partiality is the number a reader acts on, and it would be wrong. Notice also
that `shown` is legitimately `0` here — a partial listing can honestly show nothing, which is
precisely why it must not also print a total that implies it found nothing.

The same discipline is visible at session start:

```bash
hook session-start 01-session-start.json
# mubit: hosted · run … · global lessons: partial listing
```

Not "0 global lessons". Zero is a claim; this is a listing that ran out.

### 11d — An MCP write still earns a reflect

Reflect at session end is what carries a run's lessons into later sessions, and session end
decides whether to make it. That decision used to read the hook-side spool alone — so a session
whose only memory activity went through the MCP looked, from session end, like a session that
did nothing.

Drive it: a session that opens, writes one lesson through the MCP, and captures nothing.

```bash
node labs/setup.mjs --reset && node labs/setup.mjs
# restart the fake instance, then:
hook session-start 01-session-start.json
mcp mubit_learned '{"text":"The demo app listens on 3000, not 8080."}'
peek marker            # captured ingested=0  ·  mcp ingested=1
hook session-end 08-session-end.json
```

```
  POST /v2/control/activity   ← session start read standing lessons
  POST /v2/control/ingest     ← the MCP write
  POST /v2/control/reflect    ← session end reflected anyway
```

Zero hook captures, and it still reflected. The link is one term in the run marker: the egress
guard records a successful MCP ingest, and session end counts it. Delete `mcp.ingested` from
the marker between the two commands and the reflect disappears — worth doing once, because it
is the shortest proof that the two surfaces are joined by that one field and nothing else.

**`mubit_learned` takes `text`, not `content`.** Easy hours to lose. Check what you wrote
rather than only whether the call returned.

### 11e — The same commands against a real instance

```bash
node labs/mcp-drive.mjs --live \
  --data-dir ~/.claude/plugins/data/mubit-memory-mubit \
  --tool mubit_lessons --args '{}'
```

`--live` deletes the lab's endpoint and key from the child environment so the stored
credential decides both. Deleting rather than blanking is the trick: an empty string is still
a value, and config resolution would take it.

**Why not the test harness?** `test/helpers/harness.mjs` overrides `MUBIT_API_KEY` with a
fixture and `HOME` with a temp directory, which is correct for tests and fatal for a live
drive: the calls go out with the wrong key and come back as a generic failure. That is the gap
this driver fills, and the reason it is a lab tool rather than a test helper.
